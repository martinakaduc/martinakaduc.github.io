Hello everyone,

As a research team formed from members in Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) - VNU-HCM and Stanford University, we are pleased to introduce our large language models to the community. We affectionately refer to those language models as **URA-LLaMa**. They are fine-tuned on Vietnamese datasets from Meta's original LLaMa-2 model, including all three versions of 7B, 13B, and 70B.

## Model Family

We provide these models free of charge for research purposes. Our models come with evaluation results on 10 different tasks, covering various aspects and real-world usage scenarios.
