**SAVING THE DAY...**

University is like a bus stop in front of the school gate. Get on, go, and then come back, starting a new semester again. Get on, go and never come back, then graduate...

The four-year journey with Bach Khoa in the role of a student has officially come to an end for me. Four years of youth, four years dedicated to Bach Khoa, more specifically, the months and days spent facing tight deadlines with comrades, friends, the moments of joy when receiving scholarships, and also the sorrows of losing a few things.

Today, wearing the graduation gown, I believes that this is not just my own effort but also depends heavily on the care of family, the guidance of teachers, the support of siblings and friends, and the uncles and aunts within the relationships. And truly, there are no words to fully express, and no book can capture all the love that everyone has given to me.

Therefore, on this occasion, I would like to express the most sincere gratitude to everyone who has helped and supported him throughout the challenging journey of growth.

I hopes to continue receiving love and trust from everyone and to accompany everyone in the upcoming journey full of ups and downs and challenges.

Sincerely,\
**Engineer Nguyễn Quang Đức**\
