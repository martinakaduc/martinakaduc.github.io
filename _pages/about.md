I am **Duc Q. Nguyen**, also known as **Martin Nguyen**, a first-year PhD student supervised by Professor [Tan Zhi Xuan](https://ztangent.github.io/) at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). My research is driven by a primary goal -- to amplify human potential through artificial intelligence. My current work focuses on **human-AI alignment**, **generative models**, and **probabilistic methods**. I aim to develop methods that facilitate effective human-AI collaboration to enhance capabilities in critical domains such as **healthcare** and **education**.

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from [Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT)](https://hcmut.edu.vn/) - [VNU-HCM](https://vnuhcm.edu.vn/). During that time, I was mentored by [Sang T. Truong](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sttruong/) and supervised by Professor [Sanmi Koyejo](https://sanmi.cs.illinois.edu/) and Professor [Tho Quan](https://cse.hcmut.edu.vn/qttho/doku.php), working on diverse projects including drug discovery, subgraph matching, and large language models for Vietnamese.
