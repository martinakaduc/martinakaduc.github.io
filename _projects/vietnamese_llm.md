Recently, large language models have achieved state-of-the-art results on many natural language processing tasks. It is believed that large language models can learn the knowledge of the world from the text data. As the era of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is coming, large language models are considered as one of the key technologies to achieve AGI.

## Key Projects

### URA-LLaMa Family
Fine-tuned Vietnamese LLMs from Meta's LLaMa-2 model, including 7B, 13B, and 70B versions.

- [URA-LLaMa 13B](https://huggingface.co/ura-hcmut/ura-llama-13b)
- [URA-LLaMa 70B](https://huggingface.co/ura-hcmut/ura-llama-70b)

### MixSUra & GemSUra
Vietnamese language models based on Mixtral and Gemma architectures.
- [MixSUra Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/ura-hcmut/mixsura-65d6fae4fc2da9f5bdf59a79)
- [GemSUra Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/ura-hcmut/gemsura-65da96cd27be2e8c65f17131)

### Vision-Language Models
Integrating vision capabilities with LLMs using the LLaVA architecture:
- MixSUraV
- GemSUraV 7B, 2B

## Research Interests
- Developing new large language models for low-resource languages
- Applying LLMs to solve real-world problems
- Cross-lingual transfer learning
