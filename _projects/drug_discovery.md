Drug discovery is a complex, expensive, and time-consuming process. It involves the identification of a target, screening of a large number of molecules, and optimization of the selected molecules. The process of drug discovery can be accelerated by using machine learning and deep learning.

## Graduate Thesis

My graduate thesis focused on the application of deep learning to drug discovery, specifically building pharmacophore models for COVID-19 Mpro (Main Protease).

### Approach

1. **Binding Affinity Prediction**: Using deep learning to predict the binding affinity of molecules to target proteins
2. **Binding Site Identification**: Finding the binding site of molecules on target proteins
3. **Pharmacophore Modeling**: Building pharmacophore models of molecules
4. **Drug Screening**: Screening large molecule databases for promising candidates

### Demo System

Try our drug discovery system: [Link](http://www.ura.hcmut.edu.vn/vidok)

The system provides:

- Pharmacophore model visualization
- Drug-target interaction prediction
- Molecule screening and recommendation
