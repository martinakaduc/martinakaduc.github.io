Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. Currently, existing classical algorithms can solve these problems effectively. However, these algorithms are not scalable and cannot be applied to large-scaled graphs.

## Research Focus

I explore how to use Deep Learning to solve graph theory problems with targeted large-scaled graphs and applications in drug discovery, social network analysis, etc.

## Master's Thesis

My Master's thesis focuses on enhancing subgraph isomorphism prediction models to improve scalability and interpretability, particularly for applications in drug design. I introduce **xNeuSM**, an Explainable Neural Subgraph Matching framework, which leverages Graph Learnable Multi-hop Attention Networks (GLeMA) to dynamically learn attention decay parameters across multiple hops.

### Key Results
- Higher accuracy than approximate baselines
- Query times at least **7x faster** than exact algorithms
- Practical for large-scale molecular analysis in drug discovery
