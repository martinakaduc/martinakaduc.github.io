Part 2: A Journey of Trial and Error – Research Practicing at Stanford University
Recap August 31, 2024 – January 13, 2025&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part 2.1. The First Day at Stanford&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Returning from Singapore, I hurriedly packed my belongings for the upcoming long business trip. This time, it would surely be more challenging, as the destination was a Western country with a completely different culture. I felt very fortunate to be hosted by Professor Sanmi Koyejo and Mr. Sang Truong during my time at Stanford. I owe them deep gratitude for giving me the opportunity to come to a school that had long been one of my biggest dreams during my student years. For someone like me—a first-generation student—setting foot in this university once seemed completely out of reach. This would likely be a long journey filled with countless challenges and a ton of things to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Arriving at Tan Son Nhat Airport late at night, I sat waiting on the seats across from the check-in counters. I watched as crowds of people rushed to line up, moving back and forth in a hurry to catch their departures. Some, including myself, sat calmly on the benches, eyes gazing into the distance as if afraid to miss a single moment. Although the trip was originally planned to last only three months, I still felt a lingering sadness, like a child about to leave home for school for a long time. At that moment, I thought of my family, my teachers, and the people who loved me—the ones who had placed so much hope in me. I quietly told myself that no matter what, I had to complete this trip and return home safely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Landing in San Francisco a little after 7 a.m., even though I had prepared both cash and bank cards, the Clipper card vending machine at the airport still left me bewildered. Damn it! What kind of confusing machine has that many buttons? After a while of carefully reading the instructions, I finally managed to buy a card to board the BART to the nearest CalTrain station. Thankfully, I had already arranged to meet up with Sang, and we boarded the same train to Palo Alto. This was our second time meeting in person. The weather that day was sunny and pleasantly cool. In the morning light, America revealed itself with a beauty that was both wild and modern. The scenery had a harmonious tone—not too glaring—yet it conveyed a sense of stability and long-standing development. On the train, we took the opportunity to chat casually. It had probably been a long time since our conversations weren&amp;rsquo;t just about optimization, expectations, or entropy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Getting off at the Palo Alto station, we walked a stretch to reach the Trader Joe’s grocery store, located right on the edge of Stanford&amp;rsquo;s campus. There, for the first time, I had to learn how to think about ingredients to cook a complete meal by myself. It sounds like such a basic thing, but for someone like me who lived in dorms for four years, cooking an entire meal from scratch was a completely new experience, especially in a place where most of the products were unfamiliar. (Previously, I only helped my mom with small parts; I had never actually done it all on my own from A to Z.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why do all the vegetables here look so similar? There are way too many types of sauces and seasonings! What should I even buy? I wished someone could rescue me at that moment—otherwise, I’d probably be stuck in that store for another two hours. And yes, that someone turned out to be none other than the person who took the CalTrain ride with me earlier. Swift and efficient, he helped me pick out all the ingredients and spices I needed to cook a proper meal. And as you may have guessed, he was also the one who cooked our lunch that day. I still vividly remember the dish: stir-fried beef with mushrooms, baby corn, and green peas. At that moment, I thought to myself that if I could rate this chef, I’d give him five stars without hesitation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After lunch, we headed off to pick up a used bicycle. I had asked Sang in advance to contact the seller, who happened to be a PhD student at the school, and I bought it for $150. Once we had the bike, Sang naturally became my tour guide, taking me around the campus. We dropped by Panda Express and ordered Fried Rice with Beijing Beef and Teriyaki Chicken, right after visiting the bike shop to buy a new helmet. From CERAS, Tresidder Memorial Union, and Memorial Church to the William Gates Building, we passed by the School of Medicine and eventually sat down on a bench next to the Paul G. Allen Building. My first impression of the university was just how massive the campus was—probably as big as several districts combined in Ho Chi Minh City. The weather was around 26°C, pleasantly cool (though to be honest, I still haven’t gotten used to the Fahrenheit system). Looking down Jane Stanford Way, we chatted about the culture and people here while taking a break, partly because we were both exhausted from nearly two hours of continuous cycling and walking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After about 30 minutes, we went back to pick up the bike near the School of Medicine. After sitting under the sun for a while, the rear tire had gone flat without us noticing. It was probably because the inner tube was too old—the seller had never replaced it before. We had to return to the on-campus bike shop to replace the tire, but by then it was already around 3 PM on a weekend, so the staff told us the repair would have to wait until the next day. Fortunately, there was a better option: we could purchase a new tire and borrow the tools to do the replacement ourselves. And just like that, I unexpectedly became a bike mechanic. One day, I’ll tell my kids that their dad once replaced a bike tire without even watching a single YouTube tutorial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You’d think the misfortune ended there, right? Nope. The universe decided that would be too smooth. The second disaster struck: the tire blew out on our way back to the apartment. Yep, a blowout. The reason? The bike shop had accidentally sold us a tire that was too small. So once again, we found ourselves returning to the bike shop for the third time in a single day to get a new tire. After explaining the situation, the shop owner kindly gave us the correct size free of charge. I suppose I should avoid going back there too often—the owner probably recognizes me by now. Thankfully, this time, the bike made it back to the apartment safe and sound.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That first day came to a gentle close once I was back at the apartment. After dinner, I got straight back to work that very evening. First experiences are always the most unforgettable. The memory of that day remains crystal clear every time I look back. Not just because of the stunning campus architecture—both classic and modern—but also because of those three trips to the bike shop (Liu Bei once made three visits to the thatched cottage of Zhuge Liang; I made three visits to the bike shop, haha). It was as if time had frozen at that moment—the kind of day I never imagined could ever happen in my life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Valentine's Day Story.</title><link>https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/valentine-day/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 10:10:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/valentine-day/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today marks the 7th anniversary of their relationship&amp;hellip;.
The young man is very excited because today he has meticulously prepared to propose to the girl. There are 99 roses, candles, an engagement ring, and even a perfect script to make today one of the most significant days of his life. He practiced singing the song &amp;ldquo;Because It&amp;rsquo;s You&amp;rdquo; hundreds, if not thousands, of times, hoping to create a surprise for the girl. The once determined and aspiring young man has now grown into an accomplished researcher, becoming more mature with each passing day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for the girl, a daughter of Saigon, she has always been the center of attention for many young men. Not only for her beauty and charming demeanor but also because she is one of the top students in her department. Back then, she chose to love him at the beginning of their first year at university, simply because he was a good person with ambition. Since loving him, she has discovered many flaws in herself and has strived to improve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout the month, she noticed that he seemed mysterious, often going somewhere or disappearing for hours. Despite her attempts to inquire, he only responded vaguely. &amp;ldquo;There must be a problem!&amp;rdquo; she thought. However, with nearly 7 years of love and absolute trust, she simply believed that he might be facing some difficult issues. If it were another woman, she would have made a fuss and investigated thoroughly, but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t like that. It was one of the qualities the young man liked most about her – calm and warm instead of noisy and chaotic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, today has arrived. He arrives to pick her up an hour earlier than scheduled, breaking the norm. With meticulously chosen attire – a light yellow long-sleeved shirt, black trousers, and dark brown leather high-top shoes – he looks like a prince stepping out of a French-style grand castle. In his hand, he holds a bouquet of roses to kick off this special day. As for the girl, she chooses a moderately short sky-blue dress with puffed sleeves reminiscent of Disney princess dresses. A light green bow complements her outfit. She does her makeup in a light, everyday style before leaving her room and descending the stairs. She sees him waiting with the rose bouquet in hand. &amp;ldquo;Damn! What is he up to?&amp;rdquo; she thinks to herself. He hands her a flower and then takes her on the Cup50, their companion throughout the years, for a tour around the city – from the book street to Ben Thanh Market and finally stopping at a riverside café in Saigon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As usual, he orders a hot cappuccino while she opts for a cool cocktail, a choice often made by independent-minded girls. Glancing across the street, she notices a flower vendor selling Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day flowers, with one large rose standing out in the middle. &amp;ldquo;Certainly, any girl who receives that rose will be very happy,&amp;rdquo; she says, pointing towards the rose. The young man smiles knowingly, understanding that everything is part of his plan. &amp;ldquo;You think so?&amp;rdquo; he replies after taking a sip of his coffee. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but the probability is very high,&amp;rdquo; she responds. &amp;ldquo;Well, stop daydreaming, silly.&amp;rdquo; She doesn&amp;rsquo;t answer because she knows he isn&amp;rsquo;t the romantic type; in reality, scientists prefer simplicity. Suddenly, an argument breaks out in the café between a couple, and they both turn to look. Above, near the screen playing the café&amp;rsquo;s favorite music, another couple stands out. The argument gets louder, and the young man suggests helping them. At that moment, the other man raises his hand, seemingly ready to physically intervene with the woman. Some people rush to intervene. The young man seems to disappear from the girl&amp;rsquo;s sight in the crowd. She tries to stand up to see where her boyfriend is, and the man says, &amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re good, look at the screen.&amp;rdquo; Hearing that, she becomes somewhat puzzled, not knowing what will happen. Suddenly, the familiar notes of the song &amp;ldquo;Because It&amp;rsquo;s You&amp;rdquo; begin playing. The screen starts showing images of her, him, and the happy moments they&amp;rsquo;ve shared over the past 7 years. Her heart rate exceeds 140 bpm, and the adrenaline level in her blood doubles. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do, just standing there, tears streaming down her face. People in the café begin to move aside, creating an atmosphere as if they are anticipating something special.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Holding a carefully crafted bouquet of 99 roses, he walks towards her, singing their love song. Approaching her, he opens the ring box attached to the rose bouquet, kneels down beside her, and says, &amp;ldquo;Thank you for choosing me and being with me for the past 7 years. We&amp;rsquo;ve experienced many ups and downs in life, and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to always have you by my side, supporting and sharing the joys and sorrows. Today is a special day for all couples in love, and it&amp;rsquo;s also a very special day for us. Here, in this moment, I hope you give me the opportunity to complete the 100th rose in this bouquet and to become an indispensable part of your life from now on.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Damn, what kind of emotion is this?&amp;rdquo; she says, both touched and happy. However, being one of the outstanding students in the department, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t forget to challenge her lover. &amp;ldquo;So, is Bayesian Optimization locally optimal or globally optimal?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Asked unexpectedly and entirely off-script, but with rich experience from previous research with AI, he is somewhat confident in his answer. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s locally optimal,&amp;rdquo; he replies. The girl&amp;rsquo;s face changes, her voice becomes more determined, &amp;ldquo;Locally optimal can&amp;rsquo;t reach 100, can it?&amp;rdquo; Saying that, she turns abruptly towards the street, hails a taxi, and heads straight home. From then on, he can no longer contact her, and he continues to enjoy his single life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(To be continued)&lt;br>
Conclusion 1: Bayesian Optimization is globally optimal.&lt;br>
Conclusion 2: Researchers are often quite simple.&lt;br>
Conclusion 3: Young people, don&amp;rsquo;t believe too much in romance novels.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bachelor Graduation</title><link>https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/bachelor-graduation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 22:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/bachelor-graduation/</guid><description>&lt;p>SAVING THE DAY&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>University is like a bus stop in front of the school gate. Get on, go, and then come back, starting a new semester again. Get on, go and never come back, then graduate&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The four-year journey with Bach Khoa in the role of a student has officially come to an end for me. Four years of youth, four years dedicated to Bach Khoa, more specifically, the months and days spent facing tight deadlines with comrades, friends, the moments of joy when receiving scholarships, and also the sorrows of losing a few things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, wearing the graduation gown, I believes that this is not just my own effort but also depends heavily on the care of family, the guidance of teachers, the support of siblings and friends, and the uncles and aunts within the relationships. And truly, there are no words to fully express, and no book can capture all the love that everyone has given to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, on this occasion, I would like to express the most sincere gratitude to everyone who has helped and supported him throughout the challenging journey of growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hopes to continue receiving love and trust from everyone and to accompany everyone in the upcoming journey full of ups and downs and challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sincerely,&lt;br>

It is so widespread that even children who have just learned to read or write, and street vendors on the sidewalks, have likely heard and used it at least once. While each of us may have our own definition of self-learning, in terms of the concept, it can broadly be understood as &amp;ldquo;Self - Learning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what does &amp;ldquo;Self&amp;rdquo; mean? For me, &amp;ldquo;Self&amp;rdquo; encompasses several meanings: self-awareness, self-assessment, self-action, and self-pride. Self-awareness allows us to have a consciousness of studying, working on time, following schedules without procrastination or prolonged periods. Self-assessment helps us understand where we are, what position we are in, and how to continue striving scientifically and efficiently. Self-action means that we must take action for ourselves, seek what is necessary and beneficial, and start implementing it. Lastly, self-pride. Once we have gone through self-awareness, self-assessment, self-action, and achieved what we expected, we have the right to take pride in our accomplishments, in what we have, and what we have achieved. Perhaps these results are not perfect in the literal sense, but at least they reflect the process of our hard work, effort, and sweat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following &amp;ldquo;Self,&amp;rdquo; we have &amp;ldquo;Learning.&amp;rdquo; Why is it &amp;ldquo;Learning&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;Study,&amp;rdquo; or any compound nouns with the word &amp;ldquo;Learn-&amp;rdquo; at the forefront? From my perspective, &amp;ldquo;Learning&amp;rdquo; encompasses both &amp;ldquo;Study&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Practice.&amp;rdquo; During the &amp;ldquo;learning process,&amp;rdquo; we can easily encounter various learning methods: learning by doing (Studying), learning and then practicing applying what was taught (Learning by practice), observing others and learning from them (Learning by observation), &amp;hellip; But my friend, I am sure that, sooner or later, your learning process will encounter obstacles. And at that moment, I am confident that if you genuinely desire to study seriously from the beginning, you will start fervently seeking solutions to that problem immediately, right? At this point, the knowledge you have accumulated seems to be trapped in a box full of chaos, and what you need most at this time&amp;hellip; ask yourself&amp;hellip; is it &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo; from someone to connect the chaos in your head? To be straightforward, do these questions and uncertainties become the final barrier preventing you from fully grasping knowledge? &amp;hellip; For that reason, from my point of view, &amp;ldquo;Learning&amp;rdquo; carries a more serious meaning to help us progress further, to have a deeper understanding of the knowledge we have learned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Integrating both concepts, &amp;ldquo;Self&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Learning,&amp;rdquo; we get a fresher concept, &amp;ldquo;Self-learning.&amp;rdquo; Based on the evidence presented above, we can easily see that &amp;ldquo;Self-learning&amp;rdquo; does not mean just focusing on devouring a textbook, doing a bunch of exercises, or forcing yourself to master all the essence of a subject. For me, &amp;ldquo;Self-learning&amp;rdquo; must be a process of seeking your own learning path. More clearly, &amp;ldquo;Self-learning&amp;rdquo; will include three steps. First, set for yourself a passion, a specific schedule of achievable goals corresponding to time frames (and of course, this is just an initial estimate). The second step is to follow the established principles. This step is the most difficult, easy to give up, and most easily distorted. However, if you can adhere to the principles set for a long enough time, it will become a habit that helps us have a persistent will and a stronger spirit. In this step, routine tasks will include: finding relevant materials and figuring out how to digest them, testing yourself with exercises, related practical tasks, trying every way to solve problems in your own way. And the final step is when we encounter a problem that we cannot find a solution to, or the solution we come up with does not satisfy us, this is the most appropriate time to seek help from: teachers, parents, friends, experts, blogs, forums, &amp;hellip; And then&amp;hellip; go back to the second step. With this three-step process, we can easily see that external help is part of the &amp;ldquo;Self-learning&amp;rdquo; process and does not violate the initial concepts of this process. Quite simply, to get help, we have to &amp;ldquo;Self&amp;rdquo; seek the right person who can guide us to solve the problem, and &amp;ldquo;Learning&amp;rdquo; learn from their solutions, their way of thinking. In that process, we have to know how to present our issues and know what help we need from them. In summary, self-learning and learning from external help, though two but one, and we cannot deny the individual benefits of each process. If you don&amp;rsquo;t self-learn and rely entirely on external help, soon enough, you will become dependent and conform to what is passed down. On the contrary, if you only self-learn without external help, we may fall into arrogance, self-satisfaction, and may lead to distortions in the knowledge acquired. Only when we harmoniously combine these two processes, creating a unified process, can we progress further, have the opportunity to interact, learn from various sources, and enrich our knowledge on our own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the purpose of this article is just a momentary whimsy, and this is entirely my perspective. I do not hope to change people&amp;rsquo;s thinking, but on the contrary, I hope to provide a new and profound view of the two words &amp;ldquo;Self-learning&amp;rdquo; in practice from the perspective of my personal experience. I am open to feedback from everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Warm regards.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>For growing us</title><link>https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/for-growing-us/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Mar 2020 10:10:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/for-growing-us/</guid><description>&lt;p>Each of us was born and grow up by the laws of nature that no one can resist. In such a long and arduous journey, there must be many times we certainly face some traumas from this life. Perhaps they are falls, scars by carelessness, or the words and actions of others that immerse us in the despair about ourselves. On the path to becoming a true adult, we are continuously looking for solutions and answers for past traumas; but unintentionally, we hurt others. Others here are not strangers, they can be our families, friends, lovers, colleagues&amp;hellip; And thus, the injuries have not been healed, but increasingly spread out. This makes the growing-up journey more and more difficult. But anyway, you still have to grow up and find the right answer for your own life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have heard a quote like this “Strength of a person is shaped in his own weakness&amp;quot;. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what you think, but to me, growing up is a &amp;ldquo;thorn&amp;rdquo;. Why? I will tell you stories that you may have been the protagonists of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You saw a dog growling, your mother tells you to stay away from it and draw scary scenes. So, you are afraid of dogs 🙂&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You asked to study an art subject that you like, but your family objected. And then your family praises another child with that talent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The neighbor kid dropped in and took or broke an item that you like so much. And adults say it was okay.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parents often say that you are lazy to exercise. But every time go out of the house for a little bit long, sure to hear their complaints.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You absolutely don’t like that boring math, but you must learn because 3 generations of your family are excellent doctors.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are bullied by older children, but can&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone. Not because you don&amp;rsquo;t want to say it, but because you know that you&amp;rsquo;ll receive apologies at the most. You are too gentle!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone expects you to pass that exam, but your result is not as expected even though you try your best. And people think that you have not tried enough although your learning conditions are far behind those who luckily pass.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The harsh truth is that there is no way to grow in sweetness. Growth is a path full of roses, but every rose has its thorns, the thorn is small but can tear all the courage in you, enough to make you fall, make you extremely disappointed. But you have to stand up and move on your own feet, heal the scratches printed for years in the depths of your soul. Only having passed by yourself, you can feel the beauty and sweet scent on each red rose petal, which is also what build up you at the present. The red color of flowers is your own sweat, tears and blood. It is the most practical evidence for the efforts you made to stand here today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do you know? One of the things that makes people more mature is a broken love. Even if today you cry your eyes out for someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love you, the next day you still have to have a bright smile to welcome the sunrise. Because maturity is when you learn to love yourself. For a caterpillar, becoming a butterfly means going through extremely painful cocoons and molting. But after all, the used-to-be-ugly caterpillar has become a beautiful butterfly with all patterns on the wings. Can you see, in order to grow up, humans as well as caterpillar have to suffer pain and hurt to find a way to heal themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fine line between children and adults is maturity. You can choose to be a child because children only have to eat, play, study and sleep. Adults are a somewhat better version than children because they have been battered many times, and after each fall, they stand up and move on, try to reach their goal on the chosen path. So adults may have a stronger mind, be able to make their own dreams come true - something that children cannot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although growing up means suffering, if not experiencing, an adult is just a child in an ageing body - an incomplete adult. Perhaps because maturity is a thorn that everyone gets at least one stab. But when you are young, any wound will be easier to heal, enthusiasm of life is brimful so you can stand up and go straight, youth is the brightest, wildest, most beautiful fire. It can be extinguished many times, but after each suppression it will flare up stronger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We all know that traumas belong to individuals, but we can spread from person to person. For example, today your boss is unhappy because he just broke up with his girlfriend, and later unreasonable scolded you, although your report is very good. Then, you go home, because of that little frustration, you take it out on your family. In the end, your happiness cracked again. Do you see? Trauma though is not a serious infectious disease like COVID-2019, it also spreads very quickly and the consequences are also not so mild. Therefore, my buddies, if you are experiencing such situations, please have the most generous and sympathetic heart to understand and forgive them, don’t let yourself become a source of infection to others, it only makes you more deeply vulnerable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Creator always gives people the good things, please keep that in mind. But before you have those beautiful things, you absolutely must overcome the difficult frontier, that is growing up. And only when going through that difficult period, you can rediscover your true self, get answers to the questions that need answers in you. Hopefully, with all the available gentleness and honesty, you can face all ahead challenges, find the truth for your life and live by the person within you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Be yourself</title><link>https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/be-yourself/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 10:10:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/be-yourself/</guid><description>&lt;p>By the time you realize that all the &amp;ldquo;more&amp;rdquo; in the world are just differences, there is no inferiority in level, able to live with what you like, and if you like something you will try to have it, not because anyone has it, but because you need it, that&amp;rsquo;s the time when you cross the line of envy and live your own life.&lt;/p>

In this journey to find happiness, just wish you always remember that you have a heart, from which to keep your heart always fire. Because a good heart works when it keeps its emotional beats, not its bare beats just because it&amp;rsquo;s a part of the body. With it, you can feel what happiness really is.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is white the color of purity and innocence?</title><link>https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/the-white/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2019 10:10:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/the-white/</guid><description>&lt;p>[This post is written for literarians, or fathers or mothers who have had intention of divorce]&lt;br>
Mentioning white color, most people think of children in pure white shirts going to school every day, or unblemished and spontaneous things like a 3-year-old kid’s soul. But it’s just the tip of the iceberg, white is an extreme obsession for those is suffering severe trauma. In Le Quynh Tran’s eyes, the scariest moment of white is when family affection has begun to be rifted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Love is like a tale&lt;br>
Father has long since not read.&lt;br>
Love is like a friend&lt;br>
Mother has not met for long.&lt;br>
A white window&lt;br>
A girl with hidden tears&lt;br>
Stars are falling outside&lt;br>
In a night of twinkle moonlight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the first comparison “Love is like a tale”, the composer half opens a world full of magic. But why does he compare love with tale? Maybe because tale is about miraculous world of kids and love is about the magic between parents. The magic of love connects and leads them to be a father and to be a mother. But in the story that the father has forgotten, may that magic just get faded?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next comparison is much more ordinary. Love is like a friend but “long time no see”, it’s unforgettable but so distant. We doubtfully understand that love between “father” and “mother” has not been fervid as before. The song’s melody also partly reveals that emotion’s disappearance, we find that when being set to music, the comma is transformed from text punctuation to a silent sound which is so fast but also motionless, a silent sound is enough for listeners to feel the pain of “a girl”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Le Quynh Tran continues to insert some details illustrating the real-life tragedy of that family to his music story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Behind each frosty word,&lt;br>
Time still flies.&lt;br>
Behind the happy smile,&lt;br>
Tears still fall when no one’s watching.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps, the love between parents may not be so wonderful, instead, there are cold and apathetic words. All of those used to love so hard but they are now, with happy smiles on the outside, still blubbering when getting back home in lonely night. By song lyric, the composer also sends us a message about the love consolidation before time flies so fast and so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An empty house&lt;br>
A sleepless night like sorrows in winter nights&lt;br>
Or flowers are waiting for the spring to bloom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The special story about a cold home of “the girl” is unveiled in a music space full of white color: “ô cửa trắng” (white window), “đêm trắng” (it means sleepless night, but “trắng” also means “white”). But why it is “đêm trắng”? We get used to the word “đêm trắng” (sleepless night) as a description of the sleeplessness in anxiety. But using the word “trắng đêm” (being sleepless for the whole night) to describe a girl’s sleeplessness seems too mature for her age. The word “đêm trắng” brings about purity and innocence but a little glumness and loneliness in frigid winter nights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Le Quynh Tran always has subtly deep comparisons. He compares “đêm trắng” - a cold color with “sorrow” in winter nights - an emotion. With compact words, although not imagining the realistic white color of a sleepless night, we can partly feel for the unfortunate girl’s painful soul which is made by her lovers in her family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Le Quynh Tran’s music really makes a special impression of a personal feeling in music lover’s hearts. It is sad but not suffocating, just vague and quite anxious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Falling asleep, she is dreaming about being a swift flying in the mist,&lt;br>
Across the ocean&lt;br>
Flying to remote galaxy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With a kind heart, the composer doesn’t want “the innocent girl” to undergo the sadness when her house is not a home in the true sense of the word. He transforms her sorrow into a beautiful dream with little daisy waiting for the spring to bloom. In reality, we may not able to magic an obsessed sleepless night into happiness. However, the artist, with music in particular and art in general, can turn that into kid’s dreams looking alike folks told by the melody. That is a beautiful dream with swifts flying in the sky, across the boundless ocean, across verdant forests and interminable Mongolian grasslands and reach to the new region, where the girl would have both of a happy family and parent’s love. “White” tends to repel sadness, which seems like the story “The Little Match Girl” of Andersen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The adults in our challenging growth may lose the passionate love of the youth in our heart. The composer reminds us of the most careless and beautiful period when we still believed in that magic. Why do the parents really want to steal the happy-go-lucky world of their children?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last hidden intention of Quynh is to wake parental vocation in adults. He would like to send a message that for a kid, white should not be the color of sleepless nights or terrifying nightmares, instead, it should be the purity of “gentle dreams staying in the heart”. Images about “home”, “swifts” and “the spring” will be the representative of happiness, reunion and coziness of a family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let the white&lt;br>
Like gentle dreams staying in the heart&lt;br>
And in the roof&lt;br>
Swifts are coming back with the spring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The unfortunate children, living with the violence and curses, always have incurable pain in their soul caused by “white”. This can be compared with the most savage method of torture in the world: the white room. The common feature of both is to create psychological disorders that seem unrecoverable for the victims. So, when mentioning the white, we should think in different ways, because “the white” is not so innocent as we usually imagine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“White” is the song about children written for adults. Le Quynh Tran not only has comforted children’s heart but also has awakened parents’ love in a very subtle, deep and humane manner. In this way, he also sends a message about love and family affection to those responsible for bringing up a child. I hope that parents in similar situations can think thoroughly so that your children can have confidence, honesty, courage and resilience to face ups and downs in this life.&lt;/p>

Suppose I won and I got the money, the money is still unrighteous, because I don&amp;rsquo;t work to get it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t make anyone proud. Then everyone will look at our home: &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s lucky, it&amp;rsquo;s lucky &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t need that. I need to make myself worthy of the value of a person in the society. I think the next time if I was lucky, I would refuse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🐔Why are you so foolish? You keep saying that. If so, you have to bring it back&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🐷 No, I don&amp;rsquo;t need it. You should not need either. Because when I grow up, I will take care of your grandchildren, they have to become kind and proud persons. Speaking of themselves, when they reveal themselves to outsiders, they need be proud instead of hidden. They should be really proud of themselves instead of proving their pride. And although no one is proud of them, their parents can be proud of them.&lt;/p>

Shizuka embodies the ideal type of lover that every man desires. Specifically because she&amp;rsquo;s beautiful, has her own personality, a good education and is an excellent housewife. Why did a girl like that choose a clumsy like Nobita? In the meantime, she had many more options: perfect Dekisugi, rich Suneo and energetic Jaian? Could it be that Nobita has something more special than the others or is it because Shizuka really doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit the other three? Let&amp;rsquo;s analyze together!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">The first and also the most formidable rival is Dekisugi. This boy presents a well-educated person with perfect virtue. Why is that? Because in all fields from studying, playing sports or relationships in life, Dekisugi does very well. (There are episodes that Nobita tried to demolish him but he still did not fall below the level of quite good) Shizuka liked Dekisugi, they also have many times going out together, doing homework&amp;hellip; so why didn&amp;rsquo;t she choose Dekisugi in the end? Surely anyone who has seen Doraemon can admit that it is very rare he joined group games with friends. Every time Shizuka is in danger, Nobita comes to the rescue. That&amp;rsquo;s enough for us to consider that Dekisugi - a perfect human model should only be a dream, worthy of idol, friendzone rather than a lover.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">Next is the rich young-master Suneo. Rich background, Suneo has a life fulfilled with comfort, material. If Shizuka married Suneo, she would surely be a royal maid. Is that true? And does Shizuka like that kind of life? The answer is probably not. We easily see that due to the lack of familiarity in the family, when facing the danger, Suneo often chooses to escape and leave others. In addition, he is also boastful, very peachy and heavily dependent on his mother (each time he need help, he always calls his mother). Perhaps for all of that reasons, Shizuka put Suneo in friendzone. 😃&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">The person with the most courage and strength in the group is Jaian. Talking about Jaian, we must talk about spirit. We often see that Jaian bullies his friends very easily. But that was probably due to the genes and habitat that shaped his personality. When confronted with danger, with events in life, do we realize the nature of him. It can be said that in dangerous adventures with the group, many times Jaian was the brave person who rushed into danger, led the team. When he parted aways with Nobita, he regretted everything he did or many times for his sister that he could do anything. Thereby, we can see that Jaian is a man who is an upright man, meaning but in a rude manner. The reason that Shizuka only considered Jaian as a friend was probably because of his personality. A gentle girl will surely not choose people who are too shocked and rude. 🙂&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">And finally, it is Nobita Nobi. He has many shortcomings including: lazy, sleepy, bad at school, bad sports&amp;hellip; But is that all about Nobita&amp;rsquo;s people? The answer is definitely not :))) From the beginning, Nobita was always the most meaningful person. It is easy to see, in all of Doraemon&amp;rsquo;s long episodes, Nobita was always the one who saw through the inside of the supporting characters. He is always a personal talker, sympathetic to the supporting characters. This is a trait that the other 3 guys don&amp;rsquo;t have. Not only that, he&amp;rsquo;s also a very tolerant, tolerates person who bullies himself (there are times when he sought revenge, but compared to the number of times he was bullied, it&amp;rsquo;s not worth), tolerates each blade of grass. He is also very brave to protect the right, always trying his best to do something if he has made up his determination. Back to Nobita&amp;rsquo;s bad study, if we noticed that most of the problems were true and false, Nobita could choose all the wrong answers, this is not normal :)))&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">We go back to Shizuka. She and Nobita have always been together in every adventure, growing up and growing together. Nobita was always a support for Shizuka whenever she was in trouble. (It is easy to understand, because no one can leave the person who makes her happy) It can be consider that Nobita is the present and the future that Shizuka should respect. Because of Nobita&amp;rsquo;s appearance, Shizuka becomes more perfect. Human psychology is very complex and accepting a person who makes silly harmless mistakes both helps us feel good and helps us accept the person who is defective in us. If staying with Dekisugi, Shizuka will forever be a shadow of herself, but going with Nobita, she is a true woman that thousands of people dream about. Love is complex, we don&amp;rsquo;t need the perfect person, the one we need the most is the right person to accompany us all the way of life. And maybe Shizuka chose the right one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ladies, have you chosen a Nobita for your life?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
