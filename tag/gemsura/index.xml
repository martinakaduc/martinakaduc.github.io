Part 1: My First Overseas Journey – A Memorable Trip to Singapore 🇸🇬✨
Recap August 18–24, 2024&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We all experience “first times” in life — the first day of school, the first time living away from home, the first time crushing someone, the first job, the first research paper… These moments, big or small, carry with them hopes of change, the curiosity of the unknown, and an inevitable sense of uncertainty. But no matter how unclear the road ahead may seem, I’ve always believed the only way is forward — because hidden within uncertainty is often the richest source of discovery, just as information theory suggested nearly a century ago. Today, I want to share about one particularly meaningful “first”: my first time stepping foot on a land that isn’t my beloved Vietnam — Singapore, one of the most modern, multicultural nations in Asia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most memorable stop during my six-day journey was the National University of Singapore (NUS) — a leading institution not only in the region but across the world. I was incredibly honored to be invited by Professor Tan M. Nguyen to visit, and deeply grateful for his warm hospitality and thoughtful support throughout my stay. This special opportunity came through the kind connection of Professor Tho Quan — a supervisor who has quietly opened countless doors for his students. My deepest thanks go to both professors — not just for giving me the chance to witness a world-class academic environment, but also for allowing me to experience firsthand the welcoming and professional atmosphere of international academia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After more than 24 years in my homeland, this was my very first time traveling abroad — and understandably, I was nervous. I imagined feeling overwhelmed, out of place. But from the very first steps at Changi Airport, that fear began to fade. A kind airport staff member patiently guided me through the online immigration process. A shuttle bus driver between terminals made sure I found the right stop. Everything — from the space to the people — felt both new and strangely familiar: vibrant yet orderly, modern yet warm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At NUS, I was warmly welcomed by Professor Tan and two friends, @Thọ and @Hoàng. Not only did they take the time to show me around the campus and labs, but they also explained in great detail the stories behind each building and how different systems work in the NUS and Singapore context. I’m truly grateful for their kindness — thanks to their company, I never once felt alone in this unfamiliar place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond campus visits and rich conversations, I also carved out time to explore bits of Singapore: wandering through the lively streets of Chinatown, stopping in colorful Little India to taste palak curry with fragrant naan; gazing in awe at marine life at the S.E.A. Aquarium, strolling through the serene Singapore Botanic Gardens, and of course — snapping a few photos with the iconic Merlion 🦁. I also spent time at the Singapore Museum, where I learned more about the country’s layered, fascinating history. One of the things that left the strongest impression on me was Singapore’s public transportation system — exceptionally modern, clean, efficient, and surprisingly easy to navigate. And of course, I couldn’t leave out the food: from Teochew fishball noodles to the rich, flavorful Lion Head dish, everything was delicious and&amp;hellip; truly memorable :’)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After six short days, I returned to Vietnam with a touch of wistfulness — there was still so much more I wanted to explore and understand about this place and its people. But Singapore has already carved out a deep place in my heart — a nation both advanced and welcoming, one that sparked in me new ambitions for knowledge and growth. It was my first trip abroad — but it surely won’t be the last. This journey has left me with a sense of inspiration, gratitude, and motivation to keep moving forward. I’ve quietly made a promise to myself: one day, I’ll return — when my heart still longs to learn, and my mind remains open to the wonders of the unknown. 💫&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
