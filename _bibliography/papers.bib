	abstract = {From the end of 2019, one of the most serious and largest spread pandemics occurred in Wuhan (China) named Coronavirus (COVID-19). As reported by the World Health Organization, there are currently more than 100 million infectious cases with an average mortality rate of about five percent all over the world. To avoid serious consequences on people’s lives and the economy, policies and actions need to be suitably made in time. To do that, the authorities need to know the future trend in the development process of this pandemic. This is the reason why forecasting models play an important role in controlling the pandemic situation. However, the behavior of this pandemic is extremely complicated and difficult to be analyzed, so that an effective model is not only considered on accurate forecasting results but also the explainable capability for human experts to take action pro-actively. With the recent advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, the emerging Deep Learning (DL) models have been proving highly effective when forecasting this pandemic future from the huge historical data. However, the main weakness of DL models is lacking the explanation capabilities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel combination of the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) compartmental model and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) neural network known as BeCaked. With pandemic data provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, our model achieves 0.98 \$\$R{\textasciicircum}2\$\$and 0.012 MAPE at world level with 31-step forecast and up to 0.99 \$\$R{\textasciicircum}2\$\$and 0.0026 MAPE at country level with 15-step forecast on predicting daily infectious cases. Not only enjoying high accuracy, but BeCaked also offers useful justifications for its results based on the parameters of the SIRD model. Therefore, BeCaked can be used as a reference for authorities or medical experts to make on time right decisions.},

Meanwhile, social bots have been designed to automatically replicate the behavior of legitimate users in order to manipulate these OSNs. As a result, social bot detectors have been conducted concurrently, mostly on Twitter, in an attempt to discover new strategies for countering social bot attacks. In this paper, we propose SOBOG, a deep learning architecture that takes tweet relations, tweet semantics, and user properties into account to perform account-level and tweet-level detection.

	abstract = {For humans, the COVID-19 pandemic and Coronavirus have undeniably been a nightmare. Although there are effective vaccines, specific drugs are still urgent. Normally, to identify potential drugs, one needs to design and then test interactions between the drug and the virus in an in silico manner for determining candidates. This Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) process, can be done by molecular docking, which is too complicated and time-consuming for manual works. Therefore, it opens room for applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. In particular, Graph Neural Network (GNN) attracts recent attention since its high suitability for the nature of drug compounds and virus proteins. However, to introduce such a representation well-reflecting biological structures of biological compounds is not a trivial task. Moreover, since available datasets of Coronavirus are still not highly popular, the recently developed GNNs have been suffering from overfitting on them. We then address those issues by proposing a novel model known as Atom-enhanced Graph Neural Network with Multi-hop Gating Mechanism. On one hand, our model can learn more precise features of compounds and proteins. On the other hand, we introduce a new gating mechanism to create better atom representation from non-neighbor information. Once applying transfer learning from very large databanks, our model enjoys promising performance, especially when experimenting with Coronavirus.},

However, as bushfires spread too fast, they are often identified when they cannot control and cause significant damage. The reason is that existing works on remote sensing focus on low-level information processing, and thus, face the challenge of processing a massive amount of data in real-time. In this work, we employ complex event processing (CEP) to extract higher-level information to facilitate real-time bushfire detection. In particular, we propose a “spatial extension” to the ready-powerful CEP techniques to enable bushfire monitoring from the combinations of multiple spatial events. We further demonstrate the proposed spatial-based CEP on a real-time bushfire detection problem. Experimental results illustrate that our approach scales well while achieving the competitive detection performance.},

	abstract = {A prosthesis is an equipment provided to people who lost one or some parts of their limbs to help them having almost normal behaviors in daily or hard activities. The convenience and intelligence of devices should create easiness and flexibility for users. Artificial devices require interdisciplinary collaboration from neurosurgeons, surgical surgeons, physiotherapists and equipment development. Computer engineering plays a crucial role in the design step, supporting manufacturing, training and recognition to match the desirability of customers. Moreover, users need a wide range of different options such as an aesthetic functional material, a myoelectric mechanism, a body-powered appliance or an activity specified device. Thus, the flexible configuration, the proper features and the cost are some important factors that drive user's selection to the prosthesis. In this article, we describe an effective and powerful solution for analyzing, designing hardware and implementing software to train and recognize hand gestures for prosthetic arms. Moreover, we provide evaluation data of the method compared with similar approaches to support our design and implementation. This is fairly a complete system, making it a convenient solution for hand-cutoff people to control prosthetic hands using their electromyography signals. Statistical results with evaluations show that the device can respond correspondingly and the method creates promisingly recognition data after correct training processes. The prosthetic hardware implementation has also been simulated using a Light-emitting diode (LED) hand model with a high accuracy result.},

	abstract = {The goal of subgraph matching is to determine the presence of a particular query pattern within a large collection of data graphs. Despite being a hard problem, subgraph matching is essential in various disciplines, including bioinformatics, text matching, and graph retrieval. Although traditional approaches could provide exact solutions, their computations are known to be NP-complete, leading to an overwhelmingly querying latency. While recent neural-based approaches have been shown to improve the response time, the oversimplified assumption of the first-order network may neglect the generalisability of fully capturing patterns in varying sizes, causing the performance to drop significantly in datasets in various domains. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes xDualSM, a dual matching neural network model with interleaved diffusion attention. Specifically, we first embed the structural information of graphs into different adjacency matrices, which explicitly capture the intra-graph and cross-graph structures between the query pattern and the target graph. Then, we introduce a dual matching network with interleaved diffusion attention to carefully capture intra-graph and cross-graph information while reducing computational complexity. Empirically, our proposed framework not only boosted the speed of subgraph matching more than 10x compared to the fastest baseline but also achieved significant improvements of 47.64\% in Recall and 34.39\% in F1-score compared to the state-of-the-art approximation approach on COX2 dataset. In addition, our results are comparable with exact methods.},

	abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in large language models and multimodal models underscore the impressive strides deep learning has made in tackling sophisticated tasks previously deemed achievable solely by humans. In particular, discerning human thoughts or interests via communication and feedback is garnering attention for its potential to enable machines to provide insightful responses or recommendations. Nonetheless, despite progressive developments, preference learning from human feedback is hindered by poor sample complexity, as it primarily employs preferred responses for tuning, consequently failing to holistically capture user preferences. Moreover, it is imperative to ensure diversity in the responses generated, as this diversity is instrumental in enabling users to ascertain their genuine preferences, which in turn, is conducive to the fine-tuning of the response generation model. In this study, we introduce a novel method known as Thomas, which utilizes Bayesian neural networks for capturing user preferences, and Thompson sampling to enhance the exploration ability of the response generation model. This synergy ensures alignment of generated responses with user preferences, while preserving diversity, thus expediting the learning process. Experimental evaluations in synthetic environments affirm the proficiency of our method in swiftly adapting to user preferences and generating increasingly favored responses.},

Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, it is possible to construct bilingual dictionaries by automatically learning lexical mappings from bilingual corpora. However, procuring extensive bilingual corpora for low-resource languages, such as Bahnaric, poses a significant challenge. Recent studies suggest that non-parallel corpora, supplemented with a handful of anchor words, can aid in the learning of these mappings, which contain parameters for automated translation between source and target languages. The prevailing methodology involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and solving the Procrustes orthogonal problem to generate this mapping. This approach, while innovative, exhibits instability and demands substantial computational resources, posing potential issues in rural regions where Bahnaric is spoken natively. To mitigate this, we propose a low-rank adaptation strategy, where the limitations of GANs can be circumvented by directly calculating the rigid transformation between the source and target languages. We evaluated our approach using the French-English dataset, and a low-resource dataset, Vietnamese-Bahnaric. Notably, the Vietnamese-Bahnaric lexical mapping produced by our method is valuable not only to the field of computer science, but also contributes significantly to the preservation of Bahnaric cultural heritage within Vietnam’s ethnic minority communities.},

	abstract = {Bahnar is an ethnic minority group in Vietnam, prioritized by the government for the preservation of their cultural heritage, traditions, and language. In the current era of AI technology, there is substantial potential in synthesizing Bahnar voices to support these preservation endeavors. While voice conversion technology has made strides in enhancing the quality and naturalness of synthesized speech, its focus has predominantly been on widely spoken languages. Consequently, low-resource languages like the Bahnaric language family encounter numerous disadvantages in voice synthesis. This study addresses the formidable challenge of synthesizing natural-sounding speech in low-resource languages by exploring the application of voice conversion techniques to the Bahnaric language. We introduce the BN-TTS-VC system, a pioneering approach that integrates a text-to-speech system based on Grad-TTS with voice conversion techniques derived from StarGANv2-VC, both tailored specifically for the nuances of the Bahnaric language. Grad-TTS allows the system to articulate Bahnaric words without vocabulary limitations, while StarGANv2-VC enhances the naturalness of synthesized speech, particularly in the context of low-resource languages like Bahnaric. Moreover, we introduce the Bahnaric-fine-tuned HiFi-GAN model to further enhance voice quality with native accents, ensuring a more authentic representation of Bahnaric speech. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments based on human evaluations from volunteers. The preliminary results are promising, indicating the potential of our methodology in synthesizing natural-sounding Bahnaric speech. Through this research, we aim to make significant contributions to the ongoing efforts to preserve and promote the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Bahnar ethnic minority group. By leveraging the power of AI technology, we aspire to bridge the gap in speech synthesis for low-resource languages and facilitate the preservation of their invaluable cultural heritage.},

The government is prioritizing the preservation and dissemination of Bahnar language through online availability and cross-generational communication. Recent AI advances, including Neural Machine Translation (NMT), have transformed translation with improved accuracy and fluency, fostering language revitalization through learning, communication, and documentation. In particular, NMT enhances accessibility for Bahnar language speakers, making information and content more available.

However, translating Vietnamese to Bahnar language faces practical hurdles due to resource limitations, particularly in the case of Bahnar language as an extremely low-resource language. These challenges encompass data scarcity, vocabulary constraints, and a lack of fine-tuning data. To address these, we propose transfer learning from selected pre-trained models to optimize translation quality and computational efficiency, capitalizing on linguistic similarities between Vietnamese and Bahnar language. Concurrently, we apply tailored augmentation strategies to adapt machine translation for the Vietnamese-Bahnar language context. Our approach is validated through superior results on bilingual Vietnamese-Bahnar language datasets when compared to baseline models. By tackling translation challenges, we help revitalize Bahnar language, ensuring information flows freely and the language thrives.},

	abstract = {Over the past decades, online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook have become a significant part of people’s daily lives, particularly amid the ongoing global calamity — the COVID-19 pandemic. This gives room for social bot attacks that are designed to automatically replicate the behavior of real accounts. Most of these bots are employed for nefarious purposes such as disseminating false information, artificially amplifying the popularity of a person or movement, or spreading spam. Many studies have been conducted in an attempt to discover new strategies for identifying social bot accounts. To deal with large-scale attacks from social bots, Machine Learning has emerged as a noticeable path of bot detection problem that can handle massive amounts of data. However, the heterogeneity between studies in terms of problem statements, proposed processes, datasets, and evaluation metrics makes it difficult to assess and compare the efficiency of proposed methods. In this paper, we propose a systematic view of supervised learning methodologies for tweet-based social bot detection, ranging from shallow learning to specific deep learning models. In addition, we introduce a framework that measures various performance aspects and summarizes the in-depth analysis of the results, which were obtained using two datasets comprising 26224 labeled Twitter accounts. The results of this framework, we believe, will be beneficial as a practical guideline for other bot detection research or applications that require the use of machine learning techniques.},

However, the proliferation of fake news, particularly in the healthcare sector due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has become a significant concern. This has become a significant concern as accepting such fake news can have severe consequences on the health and lives of those who are exposed to it, leading to confusion, social disorder, and reputational damage for individuals, organizations, and businesses. Therefore, the automatic detection of fake news on social networks is of utmost importance. In this study, we propose the FANSOG model, which utilizes K-SOM to cluster articles and a graph-based model to automatically detect non-query fake news. Our findings demonstrate that the FANSOG model outperforms other state-of-the-art models in the same research direction.},

However, despite extensive pretraining on multilingual datasets, available open-sourced LLMs exhibit limited effectiveness in processing Vietnamese. The challenge is exacerbated by the absence of systematic benchmark datasets and metrics tailored for Vietnamese LLM evaluation. To mitigate these issues, we have finetuned LLMs specifically for Vietnamese and developed a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing 10 tasks and 31 metrics. We observe that finetuning can help LLMs transfer knowledge across languages, serving as an efficient way to bolster their capabilities in non-English languages. Moreover, our analysis indicates that larger models can introduce more biases and uncalibrated outputs and the key factor influencing LLM performance is the quality of the training or finetuning datasets. These insights underscore the significance of meticulous finetuning with high-quality datasets in enhancing LLM performance.},

	abstract = {Subgraph matching is a challenging problem with a wide range of applications in drug discovery, social network analysis, biochemistry, and cognitive science. It involves determining whether a given query graph is present within a larger target graph. Traditional graph-matching algorithms provide precise results but face challenges in large graph instances due to the NP-complete nature of the problem, limiting their practical applicability. In contrast, recent neural network-based approximations offer more scalable solutions but often lack interpretable node correspondences. To address these limitations, this article presents a multi-task learning framework called xNeuSM: Explainable Neural Subgraph Matching, which introduces Graph Learnable Multi-hop Attention Networks (GLeMA) that adaptively learn the parameters governing the attention factor decay for each node across hops rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Our framework jointly optimizes both subgraph matching and finding subgraph-isomorphism mappings. We provide a theoretical analysis establishing error bounds for GLeMA’s approximation of multi-hop attention as a function of the number of hops. Additionally, we prove that learning distinct attention decay factors for each node leads to a correct approximation of multi-hop attention. Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets shows that xNeuSM achieves substantial improvements in prediction F1 score of up to 34\% compared to approximate baselines and, notably, at least a seven-fold faster query time than exact algorithms. With these results, xNeuSM can be applied to solve matching problems in various domains spanning from biochemistry to social science.},

Conventional BO algorithms, however, assume static query costs, which limit their applicability to real-world problems with dynamic cost structures such as geological surveys or biological sequence design, where query costs vary based on the previous actions. We propose a novel nonmyopic BO algorithm named LookaHES featuring dynamic cost models to address this. LookaHES employs a neural network policy for variational optimization over multi-step lookahead horizons to enable planning under dynamic cost environments. Empirically, we benchmark LookaHES on synthetic functions exhibiting varied dynamic cost structures. We subsequently apply LookaHES to a real-world application in protein sequence design using a large language model policy, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness in handling multi-step planning in a large and complex query space. LookaHES consistently outperforms its myopic counterparts in synthetic and real-world settings, significantly improving efficiency and solution quality.

The number of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) is roughly 20 times fewer than the number of affected children, highlighting a significant gap in children's care and a pressing need for technological support that improves the productivity of SLPs. State-of-the-art multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for supporting SLPs, but their use remains underexplored largely due to a limited understanding of their performance in high-stakes clinical settings. To address this gap, we collaborate with domain experts to develop a taxonomy of real-world use cases of MLMs in speech-language pathologies. Building on this taxonomy, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLM across five core use cases, each containing 1,000 manually annotated data points. This benchmark includes robustness and sensitivity tests under various settings, including background noise, speaker gender, and accent. Our evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art MLMs reveals that no single model consistently outperforms others across all tasks. Notably, we find systematic disparities, with models performing better on male speakers, and observe that chain-of-thought prompting can degrade performance on classification tasks with large label spaces and narrow decision boundaries. Furthermore, we study fine-tuning MLMs on domain-specific data, achieving improvements of over 30\% compared to base models. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current MLMs for speech-language pathology applications, underscoring the need for further research and targeted development.},

Under within-subject evaluation, FA-GPNet achieves 78.19\% mean accuracy on BCI Competition IV-2b, surpassing strong traditional baselines and multiple deep networks, while remaining competitive with CapsNet.

While hackathons have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness, solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research initiatives.},
