It involves determining whether a given query graph is present within a larger target graph. Traditional graph-matching algorithms provide precise results but face challenges in large graph instances due to the NP-complete nature of the problem, limiting their practical applicability. In contrast, recent neural network-based approximations offer more scalable solutions but often lack interpretable node correspondences. To address these limitations, this article presents a multi-task learning framework called xNeuSM: Explainable Neural Subgraph Matching, which introduces Graph Learnable Multi-hop Attention Networks (GLeMA) that adaptively learn the parameters governing the attention factor decay for each node across hops rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Our framework jointly optimizes both subgraph matching and finding subgraph-isomorphism mappings. We provide a theoretical analysis establishing error bounds for GLeMA’s approximation of multi-hop attention as a function of the number of hops. Additionally, we prove that learning distinct attention decay factors for each node leads to a correct approximation of multi-hop attention. Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets shows that xNeuSM achieves substantial improvements in prediction F1 score of up to 34% compared to approximate baselines and, notably, at least a seven-fold faster query time than exact algorithms. With these results, xNeuSM can be applied to solve matching problems in various domains spanning from biochemistry to social science","tags":["Graph Neural Network","Subgraph Isomorphism","Artificial Intelligence"],"title":"Explainable Neural Subgraph Matching With Learnable Multi-Hop Attention","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sang T.

However, despite extensive pretraining on multilingual datasets, available open-sourced LLMs exhibit limited effectiveness in processing Vietnamese. The challenge is exacerbated by the absence of systematic benchmark datasets and metrics tailored for Vietnamese LLM evaluation. To mitigate these issues, we have finetuned LLMs specifically for Vietnamese and developed a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing 10 tasks and 31 metrics. We observe that finetuning can help LLMs transfer knowledge across languages, serving as an efficient way to bolster their capabilities in non-English languages. Moreover, our analysis indicates that larger models can introduce more biases and uncalibrated outputs and the key factor influencing LLM performance is the quality of the training or finetuning datasets. These insights underscore the significance of meticulous finetuning with high-quality datasets in enhancing LLM performance.","tags":["Computer science","Large language models","Evaluation","Natural language processing","Deep Learning"],"title":"Crossing Linguistic Horizons: Finetuning and Comprehensive Evaluation of Vietnamese Large Language Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nhi Ngoc Truong","Duc Q.

In particular, NMT enhances accessibility for Bahnar language speakers, making information and content more available. However, translating Vietnamese to Bahnar language faces practical hurdles due to resource limitations, particularly in the case of Bahnar language as an extremely low-resource language. These challenges encompass data scarcity, vocabulary constraints, and a lack of fine-tuning data. To address these, we propose transfer learning from selected pre-trained models to optimize translation quality and computational efficiency, capitalizing on linguistic similarities between Vietnamese and Bahnar language. Concurrently, we apply tailored augmentation strategies to adapt machine translation for the Vietnamese-Bahnar language context.

This gives room for social bot attacks that are designed to automatically replicate the behavior of real accounts. Most of these bots are employed for nefarious purposes such as disseminating false information, artificially amplifying the popularity of a person or movement, or spreading spam. Many studies have been conducted in an attempt to discover new strategies for identifying social bot accounts. To deal with large-scale attacks from social bots, Machine Learning has emerged as a noticeable path of bot detection problem that can handle massive amounts of data. However, the heterogeneity between studies in terms of problem statements, proposed processes, datasets, and evaluation metrics makes it difficult to assess and compare the efficiency of proposed methods. In this paper, we propose a systematic view of supervised learning methodologies for tweet-based social bot detection, ranging from shallow learning to specific deep learning models. In addition, we introduce a framework that measures various performance aspects and summarizes the in-depth analysis of the results, which were obtained using two datasets comprising 26224 labeled Twitter accounts. The results of this framework, we believe, will be beneficial as a practical guideline for other bot detection research or applications that require the use of machine learning techniques.","tags":["Natural Language Processing","Graph Neural Network"],"title":"Supervised Learning Models for Social Bot Detection: Literature review and benchmark","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Duc Q.

In particular, discerning human thoughts or interests via communication and feedback is garnering attention for its potential to enable machines to provide insightful responses or recommendations. Nonetheless, despite progressive developments, preference learning from human feedback is hindered by poor sample complexity, as it primarily employs preferred responses for tuning, consequently failing to holistically capture user preferences. Moreover, it is imperative to ensure diversity in the responses generated, as this diversity is instrumental in enabling users to ascertain their genuine preferences, which in turn, is conducive to the fine-tuning of the response generation model. In this study, we introduce a novel method known as Thomas, which utilizes Bayesian neural networks for capturing user preferences, and Thompson sampling to enhance the exploration ability of the response generation model. This synergy ensures alignment of generated responses with user preferences, while preserving diversity, thus expediting the learning process. Experimental evaluations in synthetic environments affirm the proficiency of our method in swiftly adapting to user preferences and generating increasingly favored responses.","tags":["Human-in-the-loop","Reinforcement Learning","Preference-based Learning"],"title":"Thomas: Learning to Explore Human Preference via Probabilistic Reward Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thanh Toan Nguyen","Duc Q.

Despite being a hard problem, subgraph matching is essential in various disciplines, including bioinformatics, text matching, and graph retrieval. Although traditional approaches could provide exact solutions, their computations are known to be NP-complete, leading to an overwhelmingly querying latency. While recent neural-based approaches have been shown to improve the response time, the oversimplified assumption of the first-order network may neglect the generalisability of fully capturing patterns in varying sizes, causing the performance to drop significantly in datasets in various domains. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes xDualSM, a dual matching neural network model with interleaved diffusion attention. Specifically, we first embed the structural information of graphs into different adjacency matrices, which explicitly capture the intra-graph and cross-graph structures between the query pattern and the target graph. Then, we introduce a dual matching network with interleaved diffusion attention to carefully capture intra-graph and cross-graph information while reducing computational complexity. Empirically, our proposed framework not only boosted the speed of subgraph matching more than 10× compared to the fastest baseline but also achieved significant improvements of 47.64% in Recall and 34.39% in F1-score compared to the state-of-the-art approximation approach on COX2 dataset.

In this paper, we propose SOBOG, a deep learning architecture that takes tweet relations, tweet semantics, and user properties into account to perform account-level and tweet-level detection. SOBOG also achieves outstanding performance on both tasks.","tags":["Graph Neural Network","Artificial Intelligence","Social Bot Detection"],"title":"Social Bot Detector using Graph Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Duc Q.

The young man is very excited because today he has meticulously prepared to propose to the girl. There are 99 roses, candles, an engagement ring, and even a perfect script to make today one of the most significant days of his life. He practiced singing the song “Because It’s You” hundreds, if not thousands, of times, hoping to create a surprise for the girl. The once determined and aspiring young man has now grown into an accomplished researcher, becoming more mature with each passing day.\nAs for the girl, a daughter of Saigon, she has always been the center of attention for many young men. Not only for her beauty and charming demeanor but also because she is one of the top students in her department. Back then, she chose to love him at the beginning of their first year at university, simply because he was a good person with ambition. Since loving him, she has discovered many flaws in herself and has strived to improve.\nThroughout the month, she noticed that he seemed mysterious, often going somewhere or disappearing for hours. Despite her attempts to inquire, he only responded vaguely. “There must be a problem!” she thought. However, with nearly 7 years of love and absolute trust, she simply believed that he might be facing some difficult issues. If it were another woman, she would have made a fuss and investigated thoroughly, but she wasn’t like that. It was one of the qualities the young man liked most about her – calm and warm instead of noisy and chaotic.\nFinally, today has arrived. He arrives to pick her up an hour earlier than scheduled, breaking the norm. With meticulously chosen attire – a light yellow long-sleeved shirt, black trousers, and dark brown leather high-top shoes – he looks like a prince stepping out of a French-style grand castle. In his hand, he holds a bouquet of roses to kick off this special day. As for the girl, she chooses a moderately short sky-blue dress with puffed sleeves reminiscent of Disney princess dresses. A light green bow complements her outfit. She does her makeup in a light, everyday style before leaving her room and descending the stairs. She sees him waiting with the rose bouquet in hand. “Damn! What is he up to?” she thinks to herself. He hands her a flower and then takes her on the Cup50, their companion throughout the years, for a tour around the city – from the book street to Ben Thanh Market and finally stopping at a riverside café in Saigon.\nAs usual, he orders a hot cappuccino while she opts for a cool cocktail, a choice often made by independent-minded girls. Glancing across the street, she notices a flower vendor selling Valentine’s Day flowers, with one large rose standing out in the middle. “Certainly, any girl who receives that rose will be very happy,” she says, pointing towards the rose. The young man smiles knowingly, understanding that everything is part of his plan. “You think so?” he replies after taking a sip of his coffee. “I don’t know, but the probability is very high,” she responds. “Well, stop daydreaming, silly.” She doesn’t answer because she knows he isn’t the romantic type; in reality, scientists prefer simplicity. Suddenly, an argument breaks out in the café between a couple, and they both turn to look. Above, near the screen playing the café’s favorite music, another couple stands out. The argument gets louder, and the young man suggests helping them. At that moment, the other man raises his hand, seemingly ready to physically intervene with the woman. Some people rush to intervene. The young man seems to disappear from the girl’s sight in the crowd. She tries to stand up to see where her boyfriend is, and the man says, “If you’re good, look at the screen.” Hearing that, she becomes somewhat puzzled, not knowing what will happen. Suddenly, the familiar notes of the song “Because It’s You” begin playing. The screen starts showing images of her, him, and the happy moments they’ve shared over the past 7 years. Her heart rate exceeds 140 bpm, and the adrenaline level in her blood doubles. She doesn’t know what to do, just standing there, tears streaming down her face. People in the café begin to move aside, creating an atmosphere as if they are anticipating something special.\nHolding a carefully crafted bouquet of 99 roses, he walks towards her, singing their love song. Approaching her, he opens the ring box attached to the rose bouquet, kneels down beside her, and says, “Thank you for choosing me and being with me for the past 7 years. We’ve experienced many ups and downs in life, and I’m grateful to always have you by my side, supporting and sharing the joys and sorrows. Today is a special day for all couples in love, and it’s also a very special day for us. Here, in this moment, I hope you give me the opportunity to complete the 100th rose in this bouquet and to become an indispensable part of your life from now on.” “Damn, what kind of emotion is this?” she says, both touched and …","date":1676369410,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676369410,"objectID":"39dd8b9bea93ff4161ea8f89f2d0c111","permalink":"https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/valentine-day/","publishdate":"2023-02-14T10:10:10Z","relpermalink":"/post/valentine-day/","section":"post","summary":"A story about a young researcher preparing to propose to his girlfriend.","tags":["Love","Life","Story","Bayesian Optimization","Deep Learning"],"title":"The Valentine's Day Story.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Duc Q.

Although there are effective vaccines, specific drugs are still urgent. Normally, to identify potential drugs, one needs to design and then test interactions between the drug and the virus in an in silico manner for determining candidates. This Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) process, can be done by molecular docking, which is too complicated and time-consuming for manual works. Therefore, it opens room for applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. In particular, Graph Neural Network (GNN) attracts recent attention since its high suitability for the nature of drug compounds and virus proteins. However, to introduce such a representation well- reflecting biological structures of biological compounds is not a trivial task. Moreover, since available datasets of Coronavirus are still not highly popular, the recently developed GNNs have been suffering from overfitting on them. We then address those issues by proposing a novel model known as Atom-enhanced Graph Neural Network with Multi-hop Gating Mechanism. On one hand, our model can learn more precise features of compounds and proteins. On the other hand, we introduce a new gating mechanism to create better atom representation from non- neighbor information. Once applying transfer learning from very large databanks, our model enjoys promising performance, especially when experimenting with Coronavirus.","tags":["Graph Neural Network","Artificial Intelligence","COVID-19","Drug Discovery","De Novo Drug Design"],"title":"Towards de Novo Drug Design for the Coronavirus: A Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Approach Using Atom-Enhanced Graph Neural Network with Multi-Hop Gating Mechanism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Duc Q.

As reported by the World Health Organization, there are currently more than 100 million infectious cases with an average mortality rate of about five percent all over the world. To avoid serious consequences on people's lives and the economy, policies and actions need to be suitably made in time. To do that, the authorities need to know the future trend in the development process of this pandemic. This is the reason why forecasting models play an important role in controlling the pandemic situation. However, the behavior of this pandemic is extremely complicated and difficult to be analyzed, so that an effective model is not only considered on accurate forecasting results but also the explainable capability for human experts to take action pro-actively.\n\nWith the recent advancement of *Artificial Intelligence* (AI) techniques, the emerging *Deep Learning* (DL) models have been proving highly effective when forecasting this pandemic future from the huge historical data. However, the main weakness of DL models is lacking the explanation capabilities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel combination of the *Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased* (SIRD) compartmental model and *Variational Autoencoder* (VAE) neural network known as BeCaked. With pandemic data provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, our model achieves $0.98$ $R^2$ and $0.012$ $MAPE$ at world level with $31$-step forecast and up to $0.99$ $R^2$ and $0.0026$ $MAPE$ at country level with $15$-step forecast on predicting daily infectious cases. Not only enjoying high accuracy, but BeCaked also offers useful justifications for its results based on the parameters of the SIRD model. Therefore, BeCaked can be used as a reference for authorities or medical experts to make on time right decisions.","tags":["Applied mathematics","Bioinformatics","Computational models","Computational science","Computer science","Differential equations","Disease modeling","Dynamical systems","Machine learning","Deep Learning","Public health","Time series"],"title":"BeCaked: An Explainable Artificial Intelligence Model for COVID-19 Forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cuong Nguyen Dang","Minh Nguyen Huynh","Duc Q.

However, as bushfires spread too fast, they are often identified when they cannot control and cause significant damage. The reason is that existing works on remote sensing focus on low-level information processing, and thus, face the challenge of processing a massive amount of data in real-time. In this work, we employ complex event processing (CEP) to extract higher-level information to facilitate real-time bushfire detection. In particular, we propose a “spatial extension” to the ready-powerful CEP techniques to enable bushfire monitoring from the combinations of multiple spatial events. We further demonstrate the proposed spatial-based CEP on a real-time bushfire detection problem. Experimental results illustrate that our approach scales well while achieving the competitive detection performance.","tags":["bushfire detection","complex event processing","spatial query"],"title":"Realtime Bushfire Detection with Spatial-based Complex Event Processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Duc Q. Nguyen"],"categories":["Life"],"content":"Self-learning, perhaps we are already quite familiar with this phrase. It is so widespread that even children who have just learned to read or write, and street vendors on the sidewalks, have likely heard and used it at least once. While each of us may have our own definition of self-learning, in terms of the concept, it can broadly be understood as “Self - Learning.”\nSo, what does “Self” mean? For me, “Self” encompasses several meanings: self-awareness, self-assessment, self-action, and self-pride. Self-awareness allows us to have a consciousness of studying, working on time, following schedules without procrastination or prolonged periods. Self-assessment helps us understand where we are, what position we are in, and how to continue striving scientifically and efficiently. Self-action means that we must take action for ourselves, seek what is necessary and beneficial, and start implementing it. Lastly, self-pride. Once we have gone through self-awareness, self-assessment, self-action, and achieved what we expected, we have the right to take pride in our accomplishments, in what we have, and what we have achieved. Perhaps these results are not perfect in the literal sense, but at least they reflect the process of our hard work, effort, and sweat.\nFollowing “Self,” we have “Learning.” Why is it “Learning” instead of “Study,” or any compound nouns with the word “Learn-” at the forefront? From my perspective, “Learning” encompasses both “Study” and “Practice.” During the “learning process,” we can easily encounter various learning methods: learning by doing (Studying), learning and then practicing applying what was taught (Learning by practice), observing others and learning from them (Learning by observation), … But my friend, I am sure that, sooner or later, your learning process will encounter obstacles. And at that moment, I am confident that if you genuinely desire to study seriously from the beginning, you will start fervently seeking solutions to that problem immediately, right? At this point, the knowledge you have accumulated seems to be trapped in a box full of chaos, and what you need most at this time… ask yourself… is it “help” from someone to connect the chaos in your head? To be straightforward, do these questions and uncertainties become the final barrier preventing you from fully grasping knowledge? … For that reason, from my point of view, “Learning” carries a more serious meaning to help us progress further, to have a deeper understanding of the knowledge we have learned.\nIntegrating both concepts, “Self” and “Learning,” we get a fresher concept, “Self-learning.” Based on the evidence presented above, we can easily see that “Self-learning” does not mean just focusing on devouring a textbook, doing a bunch of exercises, or forcing yourself to master all the essence of a subject. For me, “Self-learning” must be a process of seeking your own learning path. More clearly, “Self-learning” will include three steps. First, set for yourself a passion, a specific schedule of achievable goals corresponding to time frames (and of course, this is just an initial estimate). The second step is to follow the established principles. This step is the most difficult, easy to give up, and most easily distorted. However, if you can adhere to the principles set for a long enough time, it will become a habit that helps us have a persistent will and a stronger spirit. In this step, routine tasks will include: finding relevant materials and figuring out how to digest them, testing yourself with exercises, related practical tasks, trying every way to solve problems in your own way. And the final step is when we encounter a problem that we cannot find a solution to, or the solution we come up with does not satisfy us, this is the most appropriate time to seek help from: teachers, parents, friends, experts, blogs, forums, … And then… go back to the second step. With this three-step process, we can easily see that external help is part of the “Self-learning” process and does not violate the initial concepts of this process. Quite simply, to get help, we have to “Self” seek the right person who can guide us to solve the problem, and “Learning” learn from their solutions, their way of thinking. In that process, we have to know how to present our issues and know what help we need from them. In summary, self-learning and learning from external help, though two but one, and we cannot deny the individual benefits of each process. If you don’t self-learn and rely entirely on external help, soon enough, you will become dependent and conform to what is passed down. On the contrary, if you only self-learn without external help, we may fall into arrogance, self-satisfaction, and may lead to distortions in the knowledge acquired. Only when we harmoniously combine these two processes, creating a unified process, can we progress further, have the opportunity to interact, learn from various sources, and enrich our knowledge on our …","date":1617358210,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617358210,"objectID":"af4c744795d78b3bec07374e5a1d5865","permalink":"https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/self-learning/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T10:10:10Z","relpermalink":"/post/self-learning/","section":"post","summary":"Do you know what \"Self-learning\" means?","tags":["Personal","Life"],"title":"Self-learning","type":"post"},{"authors":["Duy Nguyen","Duc Q.

With the recent development of AI, this process is preferably automatic. However, the poor quality of images obtained from surveillance cameras might have detrimental effects on AI models. To deal with this problem, we present a pipeline dubbed as MultiDeep system, which combines several state-of-the-art deep learning models for character recognition and computer vision processes to solve problems of real camera data.

The convenience and intelligence of devices should create easiness and flexibility for users. Artificial devices require interdisciplinary collaboration from neurosurgeons, surgical surgeons, physiotherapists and equipment development. Computer engineering plays a crucial role in the design step, supporting manufacturing, training and recognition to match the desirability of customers. Moreover, users need a wide range of different options such as an aesthetic functional material, a myoelectric mechanism, a body-powered appliance or an activity specified device. Thus, the flexible configuration, the proper features and the cost are some important factors that drive user's selection to the prosthesis. In this article, we describe an effective and powerful solution for analyzing, designing hardware and implementing software to train and recognize hand gestures for prosthetic arms. Moreover, we provide evaluation data of the method compared with similar approaches to support our design and implementation. This is fairly a complete system, making it a convenient solution for hand-cutoff people to control prosthetic hands using their electromyography signals. Statistical results with evaluations show that the device can respond correspondingly and the method creates promisingly recognition data after correct training processes. The prosthetic hardware implementation has also been simulated using a Light-emitting diode (LED) hand model with a high accuracy result.","tags":["machine learning","random forest","prosthetic hand","electromyography"],"title":"Design, implementation and evaluation for a high precision prosthetic hand using MyoBand and Random Forest algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Duc Q.

In such a long and arduous journey, there must be many times we certainly face some traumas from this life. Perhaps they are falls, scars by carelessness, or the words and actions of others that immerse us in the despair about ourselves. On the path to becoming a true adult, we are continuously looking for solutions and answers for past traumas; but unintentionally, we hurt others. Others here are not strangers, they can be our families, friends, lovers, colleagues… And thus, the injuries have not been healed, but increasingly spread out. This makes the growing-up journey more and more difficult. But anyway, you still have to grow up and find the right answer for your own life.\nI have heard a quote like this “Strength of a person is shaped in his own weakness\u0026#34;. I don’t know what you think, but to me, growing up is a “thorn”. Why? I will tell you stories that you may have been the protagonists of:\nYou saw a dog growling, your mother tells you to stay away from it and draw scary scenes. So, you are afraid of dogs 🙂 You asked to study an art subject that you like, but your family objected. And then your family praises another child with that talent. The neighbor kid dropped in and took or broke an item that you like so much. And adults say it was okay. Parents often say that you are lazy to exercise. But every time go out of the house for a little bit long, sure to hear their complaints. You absolutely don’t like that boring math, but you must learn because 3 generations of your family are excellent doctors. You are bullied by older children, but can’t tell anyone. Not because you don’t want to say it, but because you know that you’ll receive apologies at the most. You are too gentle! Everyone expects you to pass that exam, but your result is not as expected even though you try your best. And people think that you have not tried enough although your learning conditions are far behind those who luckily pass. The harsh truth is that there is no way to grow in sweetness. Growth is a path full of roses, but every rose has its thorns, the thorn is small but can tear all the courage in you, enough to make you fall, make you extremely disappointed. But you have to stand up and move on your own feet, heal the scratches printed for years in the depths of your soul. Only having passed by yourself, you can feel the beauty and sweet scent on each red rose petal, which is also what build up you at the present. The red color of flowers is your own sweat, tears and blood. It is the most practical evidence for the efforts you made to stand here today.\nDo you know? One of the things that makes people more mature is a broken love. Even if today you cry your eyes out for someone who doesn’t love you, the next day you still have to have a bright smile to welcome the sunrise. Because maturity is when you learn to love yourself. For a caterpillar, becoming a butterfly means going through extremely painful cocoons and molting. But after all, the used-to-be-ugly caterpillar has become a beautiful butterfly with all patterns on the wings. Can you see, in order to grow up, humans as well as caterpillar have to suffer pain and hurt to find a way to heal themselves.\nThe fine line between children and adults is maturity. You can choose to be a child because children only have to eat, play, study and sleep. Adults are a somewhat better version than children because they have been battered many times, and after each fall, they stand up and move on, try to reach their goal on the chosen path. So adults may have a stronger mind, be able to make their own dreams come true - something that children cannot.\nAlthough growing up means suffering, if not experiencing, an adult is just a child in an ageing body - an incomplete adult. Perhaps because maturity is a thorn that everyone gets at least one stab. But when you are young, any wound will be easier to heal, enthusiasm of life is brimful so you can stand up and go straight, youth is the brightest, wildest, most beautiful fire. It can be extinguished many times, but after each suppression it will flare up stronger.\nWe all know that traumas belong to individuals, but we can spread from person to person. For example, today your boss is unhappy because he just broke up with his girlfriend, and later unreasonable scolded you, although your report is very good. Then, you go home, because of that little frustration, you take it out on your family. In the end, your happiness cracked again. Do you see? Trauma though is not a serious infectious disease like COVID-2019, it also spreads very quickly and the consequences are also not so mild. Therefore, my buddies, if you are experiencing such situations, please have the most generous and sympathetic heart to understand and forgive them, don’t let yourself become a source of infection to others, it only makes you more deeply vulnerable.\nThe Creator always gives people the good …","date":1583662210,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583662210,"objectID":"73c37b933d9745cdee7a470a9f34f403","permalink":"https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/for-growing-us/","publishdate":"2020-03-08T10:10:10Z","relpermalink":"/post/for-growing-us/","section":"post","summary":"The way to grow up is not easy, but it is the only way to find the right answer for your own life.","tags":["Personal","Life"],"title":"For growing us","type":"post"},{"authors":["Duc Q.

But it’s just the tip of the iceberg, white is an extreme obsession for those is suffering severe trauma. In Le Quynh Tran’s eyes, the scariest moment of white is when family affection has begun to be rifted.\nLove is like a tale\nFather has long since not read.\nLove is like a friend\nMother has not met for long.\nA white window\nA girl with hidden tears\nStars are falling outside\nIn a night of twinkle moonlight.\nIn the first comparison “Love is like a tale”, the composer half opens a world full of magic. But why does he compare love with tale? Maybe because tale is about miraculous world of kids and love is about the magic between parents. The magic of love connects and leads them to be a father and to be a mother. But in the story that the father has forgotten, may that magic just get faded?\nThe next comparison is much more ordinary. Love is like a friend but “long time no see”, it’s unforgettable but so distant. We doubtfully understand that love between “father” and “mother” has not been fervid as before. The song’s melody also partly reveals that emotion’s disappearance, we find that when being set to music, the comma is transformed from text punctuation to a silent sound which is so fast but also motionless, a silent sound is enough for listeners to feel the pain of “a girl”.\nLe Quynh Tran continues to insert some details illustrating the real-life tragedy of that family to his music story.\nBehind each frosty word,\nTime still flies.\nBehind the happy smile,\nTears still fall when no one’s watching.\nPerhaps, the love between parents may not be so wonderful, instead, there are cold and apathetic words. All of those used to love so hard but they are now, with happy smiles on the outside, still blubbering when getting back home in lonely night. By song lyric, the composer also sends us a message about the love consolidation before time flies so fast and so far.\nAn empty house\nA sleepless night like sorrows in winter nights\nOr flowers are waiting for the spring to bloom.\nThe special story about a cold home of “the girl” is unveiled in a music space full of white color: “ô cửa trắng” (white window), “đêm trắng” (it means sleepless night, but “trắng” also means “white”). But why it is “đêm trắng”? We get used to the word “đêm trắng” (sleepless night) as a description of the sleeplessness in anxiety. But using the word “trắng đêm” (being sleepless for the whole night) to describe a girl’s sleeplessness seems too mature for her age. The word “đêm trắng” brings about purity and innocence but a little glumness and loneliness in frigid winter nights.\nLe Quynh Tran always has subtly deep comparisons. He compares “đêm trắng” - a cold color with “sorrow” in winter nights - an emotion. With compact words, although not imagining the realistic white color of a sleepless night, we can partly feel for the unfortunate girl’s painful soul which is made by her lovers in her family.\nLe Quynh Tran’s music really makes a special impression of a personal feeling in music lover’s hearts. It is sad but not suffocating, just vague and quite anxious.\nFalling asleep, she is dreaming about being a swift flying in the mist,\nAcross the ocean\nFlying to remote galaxy.\nWith a kind heart, the composer doesn’t want “the innocent girl” to undergo the sadness when her house is not a home in the true sense of the word. He transforms her sorrow into a beautiful dream with little daisy waiting for the spring to bloom. In reality, we may not able to magic an obsessed sleepless night into happiness. However, the artist, with music in particular and art in general, can turn that into kid’s dreams looking alike folks told by the melody. That is a beautiful dream with swifts flying in the sky, across the boundless ocean, across verdant forests and interminable Mongolian grasslands and reach to the new region, where the girl would have both of a happy family and parent’s love. “White” tends to repel sadness, which seems like the story “The Little Match Girl” of Andersen.\nThe adults in our challenging growth may lose the passionate love of the youth in our heart. The composer reminds us of the most careless and beautiful period when we still believed in that magic. Why do the parents really want to steal the happy-go-lucky world of their children?\nThe last hidden intention of Quynh is to wake parental vocation in adults. He would like to send a message that for a kid, white should not be the color of sleepless nights or terrifying nightmares, instead, it should be the purity of “gentle dreams staying in the heart”. Images about “home”, “swifts” and “the spring” will be the representative of happiness, reunion and coziness of a family.\nLet the white\nLike gentle dreams staying in the heart\nAnd in the …","date":1575108610,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575108610,"objectID":"c1baa2754e442841ba9bd41a9666adb0","permalink":"https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/the-white/","publishdate":"2019-11-30T10:10:10Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-white/","section":"post","summary":"A song about children written for adults","tags":["Personal","Life"],"title":"Is white the color of purity and innocence?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Duc Q.

Nguyen"],"categories":["Life"],"content":"First let’s talk about Shizuka. Shizuka embodies the ideal type of lover that every man desires. Specifically because she’s beautiful, has her own personality, a good education and is an excellent housewife. Why did a girl like that choose a clumsy like Nobita? In the meantime, she had many more options: perfect Dekisugi, rich Suneo and energetic Jaian? Could it be that Nobita has something more special than the others or is it because Shizuka really doesn’t fit the other three? Let’s analyze together!\nThe first and also the most formidable rival is Dekisugi. This boy presents a well-educated person with perfect virtue. Why is that? Because in all fields from studying, playing sports or relationships in life, Dekisugi does very well. (There are episodes that Nobita tried to demolish him but he still did not fall below the level of quite good) Shizuka liked Dekisugi, they also have many times going out together, doing homework… so why didn’t she choose Dekisugi in the end? Surely anyone who has seen Doraemon can admit that it is very rare he joined group games with friends. Every time Shizuka is in danger, Nobita comes to the rescue. That’s enough for us to consider that Dekisugi - a perfect human model should only be a dream, worthy of idol, friendzone rather than a lover.\nNext is the rich young-master Suneo. Rich background, Suneo has a life fulfilled with comfort, material. If Shizuka married Suneo, she would surely be a royal maid. Is that true? And does Shizuka like that kind of life? The answer is probably not. We easily see that due to the lack of familiarity in the family, when facing the danger, Suneo often chooses to escape and leave others. In addition, he is also boastful, very peachy and heavily dependent on his mother (each time he need help, he always calls his mother). Perhaps for all of that reasons, Shizuka put Suneo in friendzone. 😃\nThe person with the most courage and strength in the group is Jaian. Talking about Jaian, we must talk about spirit. We often see that Jaian bullies his friends very easily. But that was probably due to the genes and habitat that shaped his personality. When confronted with danger, with events in life, do we realize the nature of him. It can be said that in dangerous adventures with the group, many times Jaian was the brave person who rushed into danger, led the team. When he parted aways with Nobita, he regretted everything he did or many times for his sister that he could do anything. Thereby, we can see that Jaian is a man who is an upright man, meaning but in a rude manner. The reason that Shizuka only considered Jaian as a friend was probably because of his personality. A gentle girl will surely not choose people who are too shocked and rude. 🙂\nAnd finally, it is Nobita Nobi. He has many shortcomings including: lazy, sleepy, bad at school, bad sports… But is that all about Nobita’s people? The answer is definitely not :))) From the beginning, Nobita was always the most meaningful person. It is easy to see, in all of Doraemon’s long episodes, Nobita was always the one who saw through the inside of the supporting characters. He is always a personal talker, sympathetic to the supporting characters. This is a trait that the other 3 guys don’t have. Not only that, he’s also a very tolerant, tolerates person who bullies himself (there are times when he sought revenge, but compared to the number of times he was bullied, it’s not worth), tolerates each blade of grass. He is also very brave to protect the right, always trying his best to do something if he has made up his determination. Back to Nobita’s bad study, if we noticed that most of the problems were true and false, Nobita could choose all the wrong answers, this is not normal :)))\nWe go back to Shizuka. She and Nobita have always been together in every adventure, growing up and growing together. Nobita was always a support for Shizuka whenever she was in trouble. (It is easy to understand, because no one can leave the person who makes her happy) It can be consider that Nobita is the present and the future that Shizuka should respect. Because of Nobita’s appearance, Shizuka becomes more perfect. Human psychology is very complex and accepting a person who makes silly harmless mistakes both helps us feel good and helps us accept the person who is defective in us. If staying with Dekisugi, Shizuka will forever be a shadow of herself, but going with Nobita, she is a true woman that thousands of people dream about. Love is complex, we don’t need the perfect person, the one we need the most is the right person to accompany us all the way of life. And maybe Shizuka chose the right one.\nLadies, have you chosen a Nobita for your life?\n","date":1569838210,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569838210,"objectID":"d4c3d52ff3de4a7f121f984413d8ab65","permalink":"https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/nobita-xuka/","publishdate":"2019-09-30T10:10:10Z","relpermalink":"/post/nobita-xuka/","section":"post","summary":"An inside of Shizuka's choices","tags":["Personal","Life"],"title":"Why did Shizuka choosen Nobita instead of Dekisugi, Suneo or Jaian?","type":"post"}]
