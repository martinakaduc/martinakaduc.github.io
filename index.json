Meanwhile, social bots have been designed to automatically replicate the behavior of legitimate users in order to manipulate these OSNs. As a result, social bot detectors have been conducted concurrently, mostly on Twitter, in an attempt to discover new strategies for countering social bot attacks. In this paper, we propose SOBOG, a deep learning architecture that takes tweet relations, tweet semantics, and user properties into account to perform account-level and tweet-level detection. SOBOG also achieves outstanding performance on both tasks.","tags":["Graph Neural Network","Artificial Intelligence","Social Bot Detection"],"title":"Social Bot Detector using Graph Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Nguyen","Khoan D.

Although there are effective vaccines, specific drugs are still urgent. Normally, to identify potential drugs, one needs to design and then test interactions between the drug and the virus in an in silico manner for determining candidates. This Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) process, can be done by molecular docking, which is too complicated and time-consuming for manual works. Therefore, it opens room for applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. In particular, Graph Neural Network (GNN) attracts recent attention since its high suitability for the nature of drug compounds and virus proteins. However, to introduce such a representation well- reflecting biological structures of biological compounds is not a trivial task. Moreover, since available datasets of Coronavirus are still not highly popular, the recently developed GNNs have been suffering from overfitting on them. We then address those issues by proposing a novel model known as Atom-enhanced Graph Neural Network with Multi-hop Gating Mechanism. On one hand, our model can learn more precise features of compounds and proteins. On the other hand, we introduce a new gating mechanism to create better atom representation from non- neighbor information. Once applying transfer learning from very large databanks, our model enjoys promising performance, especially when experimenting with Coronavirus.","tags":["Graph Neural Network","Artificial Intelligence","COVID-19","Drug Discovery","De Novo Drug Design"],"title":"Towards de Novo Drug Design for the Coronavirus: A Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Approach Using Atom-Enhanced Graph Neural Network with Multi-Hop Gating Mechanism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Nguyen","Nghia Q.

As reported by the World Health Organization, there are currently more than 100 million infectious cases with an average mortality rate of about five percent all over the world. To avoid serious consequences on people's lives and the economy, policies and actions need to be suitably made in time. To do that, the authorities need to know the future trend in the development process of this pandemic. This is the reason why forecasting models play an important role in controlling the pandemic situation. However, the behavior of this pandemic is extremely complicated and difficult to be analyzed, so that an effective model is not only considered on accurate forecasting results but also the explainable capability for human experts to take action pro-actively.\n\nWith the recent advancement of *Artificial Intelligence* (AI) techniques, the emerging *Deep Learning* (DL) models have been proving highly effective when forecasting this pandemic future from the huge historical data. However, the main weakness of DL models is lacking the explanation capabilities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel combination of the *Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased* (SIRD) compartmental model and *Variational Autoencoder* (VAE) neural network known as BeCaked. With pandemic data provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, our model achieves $0.98$ $R^2$ and $0.012$ $MAPE$ at world level with $31$-step forecast and up to $0.99$ $R^2$ and $0.0026$ $MAPE$ at country level with $15$-step forecast on predicting daily infectious cases. Not only enjoying high accuracy, but BeCaked also offers useful justifications for its results based on the parameters of the SIRD model. Therefore, BeCaked can be used as a reference for authorities or medical experts to make on time right decisions.","tags":["Applied mathematics","Bioinformatics","Computational models","Computational science","Computer science","Differential equations","Disease model","Dynamical systems","Machine learning","Deep Learning","Public health","Time series"],"title":"BeCaked: An Explainable Artificial Intelligence Model for COVID-19 Forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cuong Nguyen Dang","Minh Nguyen Huynh","Martin Nguyen","Duc Nguyen Quang","Thinh Nguyen Tien","Khuong Nguyen An","Chon Le Trung","Tho Quan Thanh"],"categories":["Deep Learning"],"content":"","date":1650901842,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650901842,"objectID":"b29502b6f080c6dc2970191ea66ec7b0","permalink":"https://martinakaduc.github.io/publication/becaked-an-explainable-ai-model-to-forecast-delta-spreading-covid-19/","publishdate":"2022-04-25T15:50:42.595Z","relpermalink":"/publication/becaked-an-explainable-ai-model-to-forecast-delta-spreading-covid-19/","section":"publication","summary":"Covid-19 is a global disaster which requires not only medical humanity but also computing power to predict, and, ideally, interpret these pandemics. Deep models can be trained to be fairly accurate. However, the mechanism of models prevents from explainability. On the hand, epidemiological approaches, e.g. SIR, help experts with insightful information. However, those need to be provided with parameter values, which become complicated in certain locations.\nThe fourth wave of the pandemic in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam in 2021 offers valuable lessons along with real and specific data. Hence, we introduce an explainable AI model known as BeCaked+ to predict and analyze efficiently the pandemic situation from the collected data. BeCaked+ combined deep learning and epidemiological models enhanced by specific parameters related to the policies endorsed by the government. Such combination makes BeCaked+ accurate and informative for policymakers to make appropriate responses.

However, as bushfires spread too fast, they are often identified when they cannot control and cause significant damage. The reason is that existing works on remote sensing focus on low-level information processing, and thus, face the challenge of processing a massive amount of data in real-time. In this work, we employ complex event processing (CEP) to extract higher-level information to facilitate real-time bushfire detection. In particular, we propose a ‚Äúspatial extension‚Äù to the ready-powerful CEP techniques to enable bushfire monitoring from the combinations of multiple spatial events. We further demonstrate the proposed spatial-based CEP on a real-time bushfire detection problem. Experimental results illustrate that our approach scales well while achieving the competitive detection performance.","tags":["bushfire detection","complex event processing","spatial query"],"title":"Realtime Bushfire Detection with Spatial-based Complex Event Processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Duy Nguyen","Martin Nguyen","Thong Nguyen","Khoi Ngo","Hung Cao","Thinh Vuong","Tho Quan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605798913,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605798913,"objectID":"0376272fc12924f6997cfa140f7c1420","permalink":"https://martinakaduc.github.io/publication/automatic-container-code-recognition-using-multideep-pipeline/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T15:15:13.322Z","relpermalink":"/publication/automatic-container-code-recognition-using-multideep-pipeline/","section":"publication","summary":"Identification of license plates on intermodal containers (or containers) while entering and departing from the yard provides a wide range of practical benefits, such as organizing automatic opening of the rising arm barrier at the entrance and exit to and from the site. In addition, automatic container code recognition can also assist in thwarting the entrance of unauthorized vehicles into the territory. With the recent development of AI, this process is preferably automatic. However, the poor quality of images obtained from surveillance cameras might have detrimental effects on AI models. To deal with this problem, we present a pipeline dubbed as MultiDeep system, which combines several state-of-the-art deep learning models for character recognition and computer vision processes to solve problems of real camera data. We have also compared our results with other pipeline models on real data and accomplished fairly positive results.

The convenience and intelligence of devices should create easiness and flexibility for users. Artificial devices require interdisciplinary collaboration from neurosurgeons, surgical surgeons, physiotherapists and equipment development. Computer engineering plays a crucial role in the design step, supporting manufacturing, training and recognition to match the desirability of customers. Moreover, users need a wide range of different options such as an aesthetic functional material, a myoelectric mechanism, a body-powered appliance or an activity specified device. Thus, the flexible configuration, the proper features and the cost are some important factors that drive user's selection to the prosthesis. In this article, we describe an effective and powerful solution for analyzing, designing hardware and implementing software to train and recognize hand gestures for prosthetic arms. Moreover, we provide evaluation data of the method compared with similar approaches to support our design and implementation. This is fairly a complete system, making it a convenient solution for hand-cutoff people to control prosthetic hands using their electromyography signals. Statistical results with evaluations show that the device can respond correspondingly and the method creates promisingly recognition data after correct training processes. The prosthetic hardware implementation has also been simulated using a Light-emitting diode (LED) hand model with a high accuracy result.","tags":["machine learning","random forest","prosthetic hand","electromyography"],"title":"Design, implementation and evaluation for a high precision prosthetic hand using MyoBand and Random Forest algorithm","type":"publication"}]
