For many applicants, this period is a time of hopelessness and dejection, as the outcome remains uncertain until the final decision is revealed. This experience is especially poignant for those who perceive themselves as &amp;ldquo;ordinary&amp;rdquo; candidates—individuals without a litany of prestigious achievements, medals, or top-tier standardized test scores. Yet, the question persists: Is there a viable path for such candidates to secure admission, or does their chance resemble a statistical anomaly, akin to the rare occurrence of a black swan?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="the-perception-of-prestige-and-the-ordinary-applicant">The Perception of Prestige and the &amp;ldquo;Ordinary&amp;rdquo; Applicant&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In current academia, admission to elite institutions is frequently associated with a well-documented profile of excellence. Successful applicants to Stanford, for instance, often boast an impressive array of accolades—research publications, international awards, and near-perfect academic records. This creates an imposing standard that can intimidate applicants whose strengths lie elsewhere. For a candidate with distinguished but unconventional experience—perhaps years of independent research, unique professional contributions, or resilience in overcoming personal challenges—the prospect of standing out amidst such competition may feel daunting. The probability of acceptance for such an individual might appear small, leading to the judgment that it constitutes a black swan event: an improbable outcome that defies expectation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nonetheless, this perspective overlooks a critical reality of admissions processes. While excellent achievements undoubtedly enhance a candidate&amp;rsquo;s profile, many programs, including those at top-tier universities, value diversity of thought, experience, and potential. A &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; applicant with a compelling narrative and demonstrated capacity for intellectual growth is not inherently excluded. The likelihood of success may be smaller than for those with traditional markers of excellence, but it is not negligible. Admissions committees are the treasure hunters trying their best to recognize the merit in candidates whose journeys deviate from the conventional path.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="slow-blooming-a-testament-to-persistence">Slow Blooming: A Testament to Persistence&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Slow blooming does not mean no blooming&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This adage offers a poignant reminder during this difficult waiting period. Academic and personal development do not adhere to a universal timeline. For some, brilliance manifests early, reflected in a cascade of awards and recognition. For others, it emerges gradually, shaped by persistence, endeavor, and unconventional experiences. The PhD application process, though often framed as a meritocratic sprint, also rewards those who have cultivated their potential over time. A candidate who lacks a glittering resume but demonstrates depth, resilience, and a clear vision for their research may still secure a slot among other excellences. The key lies in articulating this journey effectively, transforming their &amp;ldquo;seeming&amp;rdquo; ordinariness into a narrative of distinction.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="schrödingers-cat-and-the-phd-application-waiting-game">Schrödinger’s Cat and the PhD-Application Waiting Game&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The interim from submitting a PhD application to receiving a decision bears a striking resemblance to the thought experiment of Schrödinger’s cat. In quantum mechanics, the cat exists in a superposition—simultaneously alive and dead—until the box is opened and its state observed. Similarly, during the &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; waiting period, an applicant occupies a liminal space, suspended between acceptance and rejection. The outcome is unknowable until the notification email is opened in the form of an admissions letter. This uncertainty can be profoundly disorienting, amplifying feelings of dejection as weeks stretch into months. Each passing day without news reinforces the sense of being trapped in a state of limbo, where hope and despair coexist in equal measure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, just as Schrödinger’s paradox serves to illustrate the nature of observation, the PhD application waiting period underscores the importance of resilience. The applicant cannot alter the decision retroactively, but they can control their response to the uncertainty—maintaining focus on their goals, refining their research interests, and preparing for multiple outcomes. This mindset transforms the waiting period from a passive ordeal into an active phase of growth. By embracing the unknown, the applicant cultivates the resilience needed to navigate the academic landscape, regardless of the final decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="embracing-the-unknown">Embracing the Unknown&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The PhD application process, with its prolonged delays and multiple factors affecting it, tests the resolve of even the most determined candidates. For those without a traditional portfolio of achievements, the journey may feel particularly hopeless, the odds of success seemingly infinitesimal. However, the possibility of admission, though rare, is not illusory. Like a slow-blooming flower or the resolution of Schrödinger’s paradox, the outcome hinges on factors beyond immediate control—yet it remains within the realm of possibility. To navigate this period, we — applicants, must balance realistic expectations with unwavering perseverance, recognizing our unique experiences, however understated, hold intrinsic value. In the end, the dejected waiting will give you not only an answer but also a deeper understanding of your own capacity for endurance and hope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your effort will pay off, and the waiting will end. The cat will be alive, and the box will be open.
Please believe in yourself and keep the hope alive. Don&amp;rsquo;t give up. You are extraordinary in your own way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>P/S: If you haven&amp;rsquo;t had any offers yet (like me this year), please remember that &amp;ldquo;slow blooming does not mean no blooming.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

Part 2: A Journey of Trial and Error – Research Practicing at Stanford University
Recap August 31, 2024 – January 13, 2025&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part 2.1. The First Day at Stanford&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Returning from Singapore, I hurriedly packed my belongings for the upcoming long business trip. This time, it would surely be more challenging, as the destination was a Western country with a completely different culture. I felt very fortunate to be hosted by Professor Sanmi Koyejo and Mr. Sang Truong during my time at Stanford. I owe them deep gratitude for giving me the opportunity to come to a school that had long been one of my biggest dreams during my student years. For someone like me—a first-generation student—setting foot in this university once seemed completely out of reach. This would likely be a long journey filled with countless challenges and a ton of things to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Arriving at Tan Son Nhat Airport late at night, I sat waiting on the seats across from the check-in counters. I watched as crowds of people rushed to line up, moving back and forth in a hurry to catch their departures. Some, including myself, sat calmly on the benches, eyes gazing into the distance as if afraid to miss a single moment. Although the trip was originally planned to last only three months, I still felt a lingering sadness, like a child about to leave home for school for a long time. At that moment, I thought of my family, my teachers, and the people who loved me—the ones who had placed so much hope in me. I quietly told myself that no matter what, I had to complete this trip and return home safely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Landing in San Francisco a little after 7 a.m., even though I had prepared both cash and bank cards, the Clipper card vending machine at the airport still left me bewildered. Damn it! What kind of confusing machine has that many buttons? After a while of carefully reading the instructions, I finally managed to buy a card to board the BART to the nearest CalTrain station. Thankfully, I had already arranged to meet up with Sang, and we boarded the same train to Palo Alto. This was our second time meeting in person. The weather that day was sunny and pleasantly cool. In the morning light, America revealed itself with a beauty that was both wild and modern. The scenery had a harmonious tone—not too glaring—yet it conveyed a sense of stability and long-standing development. On the train, we took the opportunity to chat casually. It had probably been a long time since our conversations weren&amp;rsquo;t just about optimization, expectations, or entropy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Getting off at the Palo Alto station, we walked a stretch to reach the Trader Joe’s grocery store, located right on the edge of Stanford&amp;rsquo;s campus. There, for the first time, I had to learn how to think about ingredients to cook a complete meal by myself. It sounds like such a basic thing, but for someone like me who lived in dorms for four years, cooking an entire meal from scratch was a completely new experience, especially in a place where most of the products were unfamiliar. (Previously, I only helped my mom with small parts; I had never actually done it all on my own from A to Z.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why do all the vegetables here look so similar? There are way too many types of sauces and seasonings! What should I even buy? I wished someone could rescue me at that moment—otherwise, I’d probably be stuck in that store for another two hours. And yes, that someone turned out to be none other than the person who took the CalTrain ride with me earlier. Swift and efficient, he helped me pick out all the ingredients and spices I needed to cook a proper meal. And as you may have guessed, he was also the one who cooked our lunch that day. I still vividly remember the dish: stir-fried beef with mushrooms, baby corn, and green peas. At that moment, I thought to myself that if I could rate this chef, I’d give him five stars without hesitation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After lunch, we headed off to pick up a used bicycle. I had asked Sang in advance to contact the seller, who happened to be a PhD student at the school, and I bought it for $150. Once we had the bike, Sang naturally became my tour guide, taking me around the campus. We dropped by Panda Express and ordered Fried Rice with Beijing Beef and Teriyaki Chicken, right after visiting the bike shop to buy a new helmet. From CERAS, Tresidder Memorial Union, and Memorial Church to the William Gates Building, we passed by the School of Medicine and eventually sat down on a bench next to the Paul G. Allen Building. My first impression of the university was just how massive the campus was—probably as big as several districts combined in Ho Chi Minh City. The weather was around 26°C, pleasantly cool (though to be honest, I still haven’t gotten used to the Fahrenheit system). Looking down Jane Stanford Way, we chatted about the culture and people here while taking a break, partly because we were both exhausted from nearly two hours of continuous cycling and walking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After about 30 minutes, we went back to pick up the bike near the School of Medicine. After sitting under the sun for a while, the rear tire had gone flat without us noticing. It was probably because the inner tube was too old—the seller had never replaced it before. We had to return to the on-campus bike shop to replace the tire, but by then it was already around 3 PM on a weekend, so the staff told us the repair would have to wait until the next day. Fortunately, there was a better option: we could purchase a new tire and borrow the tools to do the replacement ourselves. And just like that, I unexpectedly became a bike mechanic. One day, I’ll tell my kids that their dad once replaced a bike tire without even watching a single YouTube tutorial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You’d think the misfortune ended there, right? Nope. The universe decided that would be too smooth. The second disaster struck: the tire blew out on our way back to the apartment. Yep, a blowout. The reason? The bike shop had accidentally sold us a tire that was too small. So once again, we found ourselves returning to the bike shop for the third time in a single day to get a new tire. After explaining the situation, the shop owner kindly gave us the correct size free of charge. I suppose I should avoid going back there too often—the owner probably recognizes me by now. Thankfully, this time, the bike made it back to the apartment safe and sound.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That first day came to a gentle close once I was back at the apartment. After dinner, I got straight back to work that very evening. First experiences are always the most unforgettable. The memory of that day remains crystal clear every time I look back. Not just because of the stunning campus architecture—both classic and modern—but also because of those three trips to the bike shop (Liu Bei once made three visits to the thatched cottage of Zhuge Liang; I made three visits to the bike shop, haha). It was as if time had frozen at that moment—the kind of day I never imagined could ever happen in my life.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
