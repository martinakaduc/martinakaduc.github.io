The process of applying for a PhD program, particularly at top-tier institutions like MIT or Stanford, often evokes a complex mix of anticipation, self-doubt, and prolonged waiting. For many applicants, this period is a time of hopelessness and dejection, as the outcome remains uncertain until the final decision is revealed. This experience is especially poignant for those who perceive themselves as "ordinary" candidates—individuals without a litany of prestigious achievements, medals, or top-tier standardized test scores.

## The Perception of Prestige and the "Ordinary" Applicant

In current academia, admission to elite institutions is frequently associated with a well-documented profile of excellence. Successful applicants to Stanford, for instance, often boast an impressive array of accolades—research publications, international awards, and near-perfect academic records. This creates an imposing standard that can intimidate applicants whose strengths lie elsewhere.

For a candidate with distinguished but unconventional experience—perhaps years of independent research, unique professional contributions, or resilience in overcoming personal challenges—the prospect of standing out amidst such competition may feel daunting.

## Slow Blooming: A Testament to Persistence

> "Slow blooming does not mean no blooming"

This adage offers a poignant reminder during this difficult waiting period. Academic and personal development do not adhere to a universal timeline. For some, brilliance manifests early, reflected in a cascade of awards and recognition. For others, it emerges gradually, shaped by persistence, endeavor, and unconventional experiences.

## Schrödinger's Cat and the PhD-Application Waiting Game

The interim from submitting a PhD application to receiving a decision bears a striking resemblance to the thought experiment of Schrödinger's cat. In quantum mechanics, the cat exists in a superposition—simultaneously alive and dead—until the box is opened and its state observed.

Similarly, during the waiting period, an applicant occupies a liminal space, suspended between acceptance and rejection. The outcome is unknowable until the notification email is opened. This uncertainty can be profoundly disorienting, amplifying feelings of dejection as weeks stretch into months.

## Embracing the Unknown

The PhD application process, with its prolonged delays and multiple factors affecting it, tests the resolve of even the most determined candidates. For those without a traditional portfolio of achievements, the journey may feel particularly hopeless, the odds of success seemingly infinitesimal.

However, the possibility of admission, though rare, is not illusory. Like a slow-blooming flower or the cat in Schrödinger's box, the applicant's fate remains undetermined until observed—and in that uncertainty lies hope.
