🐷: I think carefully, this is money collected from other people. Suppose I won and I got the money, the money is still unrighteous, because I don't work to get it. I didn't make anyone proud. Then everyone will look at our home: "That's lucky, it's lucky ..." I don't need that. I need to make myself worthy of the value of a person in the society. I think the next time if I was lucky, I would refuse.

🐔: Why are you so foolish? You keep saying that. If so, you have to bring it back...

🐷: No, I don't need it. You should not need either. Because when I grow up, I will take care of your grandchildren, they have to become kind and proud persons. Speaking of themselves, when they reveal themselves to outsiders, they need be proud instead of hidden. They should be really proud of themselves instead of proving their pride. And although no one is proud of them, their parents can be proud of them.
