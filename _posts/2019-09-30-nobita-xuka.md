First let's talk about Shizuka. Shizuka embodies the ideal type of lover that every man desires. Specifically because she's beautiful, has her own personality, a good education and is an excellent housewife. Why did a girl like that choose a clumsy like Nobita? In the meantime, she had many more options: perfect Dekisugi, rich Suneo and energetic Jaian? Could it be that Nobita has something more special than the others or is it because Shizuka really doesn't fit the other three? Let's analyze together!

The first and also the most formidable rival is Dekisugi. This boy presents a well-educated person with perfect virtue. Why is that? Because in all fields from studying, playing sports or relationships in life, Dekisugi does very well. (There are episodes that Nobita tried to demolish him but he still did not fall below the level of quite good) Shizuka liked Dekisugi, they also have many times going out together, doing homework... so why didn't she choose Dekisugi in the end? Surely anyone who has seen Doraemon can admit that it is very rare he joined group games with friends. Every time Shizuka is in danger, Nobita comes to the rescue. That's enough for us to consider that Dekisugi - a perfect human model should only be a dream, worthy of idol, friendzone rather than a lover.

Next is the rich young-master Suneo. Rich background, Suneo has a life fulfilled with comfort, material. If Shizuka married Suneo, she would surely be a royal maid. Is that true? And does Shizuka like that kind of life? The answer is probably not. We easily see that due to the lack of familiarity in the family, when facing the danger, Suneo often chooses to escape and leave others. In addition, he is also boastful, very peachy and heavily dependent on his mother (each time he need help, he always calls his mother). Perhaps for all of that reasons, Shizuka put Suneo in friendzone. 😃

The person with the most courage and strength in the group is Jaian. Talking about Jaian, we must talk about spirit. We often see that Jaian bullies his friends very easily. But that was probably due to the genes and habitat that shaped his personality. When confronted with danger, with events in life, do we realize the nature of him. It can be said that in dangerous adventures with the group, many times Jaian was the brave person who rushed into danger, led the team. When he parted aways with Nobita, he regretted everything he did or many times for his sister that he could do anything. Thereby, we can see that Jaian is a man who is an upright man, meaning but in a rude manner. The reason that Shizuka only considered Jaian as a friend was probably because of his personality. A gentle girl will surely not choose people who are too shocked and rude. 🙂

And finally, it is Nobita Nobi. He has many shortcomings including: lazy, sleepy, bad at school, bad sports... But is that all about Nobita's people? The answer is definitely not :))) From the beginning, Nobita was always the most meaningful person. It is easy to see, in all of Doraemon's long episodes, Nobita was always the one who saw through the inside of the supporting characters. He is always a personal talker, sympathetic to the supporting characters. This is a trait that the other 3 guys don't have. Not only that, he's also a very tolerant, tolerates person who bullies himself (there are times when he sought revenge, but compared to the number of times he was bullied, it's not worth), tolerates each blade of grass. He is also very brave to protect the right, always trying his best to do something if he has made up his determination. Back to Nobita's bad study, if we noticed that most of the problems were true and false, Nobita could choose all the wrong answers, this is not normal :)))

We go back to Shizuka. She and Nobita have always been together in every adventure, growing up and growing together. Nobita was always a support for Shizuka whenever she was in trouble. (It is easy to understand, because no one can leave the person who makes her happy) It can be consider that Nobita is the present and the future that Shizuka should respect. Because of Nobita's appearance, Shizuka becomes more perfect. Human psychology is very complex and accepting a person who makes silly harmless mistakes both helps us feel good and helps us accept the person who is defective in us. If staying with Dekisugi, Shizuka will forever be a shadow of herself, but going with Nobita, she is a true woman that thousands of people dream about. Love is complex, we don't need the perfect person, the one we need the most is the right person to accompany us all the way of life. And maybe Shizuka chose the right one.

Ladies, have you chosen a Nobita for your life?
