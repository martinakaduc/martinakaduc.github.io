Happiness is an invisible thing, so you cannot use reason to find and possess it but your heart. In this journey to find happiness, just wish you always remember that you have a heart, from which to keep your heart always fire. Because a good heart works when it keeps its emotional beats, not its bare beats just because it's a part of the body. With it, you can feel what happiness really is.
